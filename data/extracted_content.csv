https://www.varonis.com/blog/cybersecurity-tips,Top 10 Cybersecurity Awareness Tips: How to Stay Safe and Proactive,"cybersecurity is gaining more importance globally as technology continues to advance. the emphasis on security stems from the need for organizations to be prepared for when, not if, a data breach occurs. unfortunately, human error is often the cause of breaches. understanding how to combat cyberattacks is crucial, as protecting sensitive information is everyone's responsibility in our data-driven world. in honor ofcybersecurity awareness month, we’ve compiled the top security tips you can implement to be more secure. by incorporating these tactics, you decrease the likelihood of your information or actions causing a catastrophic breach. multifactor authentication adds an extra layer of security by verifying a user's identity through methods like receiving a verification code or clicking a link when logging in. enabling mfa is crucial because the absence of it increases your vulnerability to risks. “attackers don’t break in; they log in,” said joseph avanzato, a forensics expert at varonis, during a live session onunderstanding a threat actor’s mindset. enable mfa for services that offer it and use an authenticator app if available. report any unusual login attempts immediately. for organizations, it's best to require mfa and restrict the option to disable it. it’s tempting to create a link accessible to anyone, rather than just specific users, in the event that additional stakeholders need access. however, microsoft reports that only 1% of org-wide permissions granted are actually used. a vast amount of business documents contain sensitive information that shouldn't be accessible to everyone in the org, let alone anyone on the internet. removing the ability to create org-wide links can significantly reduce your org’s blast radius. in the average company,157,000 sensitive records are exposed to everyone on the internetthrough saas sharing features, representing $28 million in data-breach risk. rather than opting for an over-permissioned link, users should share files directly with those who need access to do their job and invite others to access on a case-by-case basis. social engineering and phishing tactics are still some of the most effective ways hackers gain access.common signs of phishinginclude a peculiar sender address, a sense of urgency in the request, and prompting users to click a link. phishing simulations are an effective way for organizations to educate teams on the impact of engaging with suspicious communications and encourage users to proactively look for scams. as a consumer or employee, it’s important to vet any unknown senders who contact you via text, email, and more. all it takes is one click to give threat actors keys to the data kingdom. to expand on tip number three, it’s not enough to shrug off a suspicious text message and call it a day. most phishing attempts target more than one user in an organization, so if you receive one, report it to your it department. some companies have plug-ins within their email service or a dedicated inbox to forward suspicious activity to. even a simple response to phishing attempts can backfire, so avoid engaging in any type of conversation. additionally, never share information or make purchases without verifying the contact’s identity. administrative access in cloud platforms like salesforce is powerful. at many organizations, existing admins can grant access to others in these tools without it oversight. this results in too many users having escalated privileges and access to sensitive information. in varonis’dspm snapshot report, we found that 60% of an average company's administrative accounts do not enable mfa, making it easier for attackers to compromise internally exposed data. many orgs are unaware ofthe shared responsibility model, which holds saas providers accountable for securing a platform's infrastructure and providing a highly available solution, while consumers are responsible for protecting and securing their data within. when someone in your organization requests admin access to an application you manage, assess if the request is justified and consider setting an expiration for the permissions to maintain security. coordinate with your it and security teams to ensure all administrators understand the shared responsibility model and adhere to the established permission protocols. imagine signing up for the latest social networking app, and to bypass filling out a lengthy form, you can simply connect it to your gmail account, thus opening up access to your information stored within this app. but while setting this connection up is easy, it’s challenging to understand how the apps are configured and what access they have to information stored in your connected service. there is also the risk that apps contain vulnerabilities that threat actors could exploit. through a single click, access can be granted to these malicious applications. thevaronis threat labs team created an attack scenarioin which we created a realistic-looking app and used a phishing technique to convince a user to install an app and grant full access to their microsoft 365 environment. while our scenario was a simulation, most hackers and ransomware groups wouldn't stop at gaining access and would further exploit the information they find. as the use of third-party apps rises, it’s essential to assess your connected apps and the risks involved with them. we recommend analyzing the permissions for each app and ranking their risk level as low, medium, or high. with varonis, organizations can see how many employees use a third-party app and view their activity levels via automation or manual reporting. to avoid breaches, users who haven’t opened a high-risk app in the last six months should have their permissions revoked. you may want to consider disconnecting the app altogether if it’s not being used. as technology has evolved, the public expects access to wi-fi nearly everywhere they go, said matt radolec, varonis’ vice president of incident response and cloud operations, inan interview with cnbc. he added that users aren’t reading the terms and conditions or checking urls when connecting to free wi-fi options, increasing their chances of compromise. “it’s almost a game to see how fast you can click ‘accept’ and then ‘sign in’ or ‘connect.’ this is the ploy, especially when visiting a new location; a user might not even know what a legitimate site should look like when presented with a fake site,” matt said. be cautious of free wi-fi networks you connect your device to, and make your computer forget them from your stored networks once you have finished your session. large language models (llms) like chatgpt can use your data to train their systems. if you share sensitive information during a chat, your data might unknowingly appear in another session or, even worse, in a hacker's hands. tools like microsoft 365 copilot are also designed to access everything the user can, which is often far too much.ensure your organization is ready to deploy ai toolssafely before, during, and after rollout. data privacy is a major concern regarding ai. organizations recognize the need to safeguard privacy while maintaining ai functionality, which can be challenging. “we want to leverage llm technology,” varonis security architect brock bauer said during a webinar onllm risks in the cloud. “we want to give the productivity capabilities to our users, but we also need to protect the privacy of the data they're accessing.” when using ai, always keep your sensitive details out of chats. security teams should set up ai policies in their orgs and ensure employees are trained to properly use approved gen ai solutions. it can be pesky to see an “automatic restart” window pop up right in the middle of an important task, but the longer you wait to update your computer, the more misconfigurations remain unpatched. patches are solutions to vulnerabilities discovered in different software and cloud platforms. in 2021,our research team identified a bug in salesforce dubbed einstein's wormhole. this bug exposed calendar events that could contain highly sensitive data such as attendee names, emails, meeting urls, passwords, and replies being sent to organizers. before the bug was patched, meeting information with potentially sensitive information was exposed to the entire internet. being proactive with your device and software updates decreases the likelihood of being compromised due to a misconfiguration. password managers let users create complex passwords for all their sign-ins, preventing threat actors from accessing their accounts. whether you use a password manager or not, it is important to create different passwords for different sites, opt for additional security measures like mfa, and set up alerts when logins occur from unknown devices or locations. these small best practices for password generation can be key to preventing data compromise in a breach. with breaches on the rise, it’s crucial to prioritize cybersecurity. following these preventative cybersecurity tips can help you have stronger security practices at work and at home. for organizations, pairing effective training with top-tier security technology creates an ideal cybersecurity solution. want to learn more? get started witha free data risk assessmentto see if varonis is the right match for you. below are three ways you can

https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/blog/11-cyber-defense-tips-to-stay-secure-at-work-and-home,11 Cyber Defense Tips to Stay Secure at Work and Home,"cybersecurity is inextricably tied to the technology it protects. just as technology continues to grow in variety, quantity, and presence in all of our lives, so too does cybersecurity and our personal responsibility for it. you might be wondering how you can best act on this responsibility. the answer? strengthen your cyber defense at home and at work. provided below are 11 steps that you can use to get started. what are your cyber defense goals? have you identified which devices and data you want to protect? what level of security do they need? by considering these and similar types of questions, you can start to formulate a cybersecurity roadmap that makes sense for you. hover over a link to reveal the destination url. if it looks different from the hyperlinked text, don’t click on it. it could be an attempt to trick you into visiting a phishing landing page. to protect yourself against phishing attacks, search instead for your intended website or enter the url directly into your browser’s navigation bar. speaking of phishing, if you receive a suspicious email at work, don’t open or click on it. instead, follow up with your it and/or security department. how can you tell a suspicious email from a legitimate one? the former will often use a sense of urgency, including a sale, an emergency, or a negative consequence such as an account closure, to motivate you to click on a link or open an email attachment. don't fall for it. if you come across this type of email, just stop, breathe, and forward it to your it and/or your security department. if you receive this type of email on your personal device, delete the email and consider blocking the domain. check out ourshort guide to phishingto learn more. cyber threat actors (ctas) can easily crack passwords like ""password,"" ""admin,"" or ""123456."" the same goes for dictionary-based passwords, or combinations made up of words that you can find in a dictionary. instead of a simple password, try using a passphrase that sometimes substitutes numbers and symbols for letters. this unique approach can help you remember long strings for added security. as an example, consider the weak password “cheese” compared to the complex passphrases “1l0v3(h33s3” (modified from ""ilovecheese"") or (modified from ""morecheeseplease""). to properly secure your devices and data, protect your laptop, smartphone, and any other device you use with a secure passphrase such as the examples above. you can also consider using biometric passcodes if your device supports this option, or you can use a pin or matric passcode for authentication. if you end up creating an alphanumeric passphrase with symbols, make sure you use unique combinations for each of your accounts. remember that you can also generate passphrases using a password manager. the benefit there is that you can have the password manager remember each of your passwords so you don't have to. all you need to do is to protect access to your password manager with a strong passphrase and with multi-factor authentication (mfa). check outourpassword policy guideto learn more. to implement multi-factor authentication (mfa), you need to protect your account with authentication mechanisms from at least two of the following categories. use a minimum of two-factor authentication (2fa) on any important accounts or computers where sensitive data is handled. that way, even if a cta gains access to your username and password, they won't be able to access your account without the other factor(s). always install the latest updates for your operating system, browser, and any applications installed on your device. ctas try to use known vulnerabilities to access your devices and/or other devices that are connected to the same network. don’t let yourself (or your organization) become an easy target. before you connect to an unfamiliar and/or public wi-fi network, think about the risks of doing so. what data might you share over the connection? to minimize the risk of data exposure, use a virtual private network (vpn). a vpn acts as a secure tunnel over the internet by creating an encrypted, private web connection. with a vpn, you can rest assured that your personal or work-related data is secure. shopping online is a modern, everyday convenience. protect sensitive banking data by only shopping on sites you trust. never save your card information where it could be stolen and used later. also, make sure to monitor your payment card records for unfamiliar charges. if you come across anything suspicious, reach out to the payment card issuer to dispute the charge and request a new payment card. configuration sounds like a big responsibility – and it's an important part of your security program. but it really comes down to the settings for a particular program or machine. securely configure your computer, printer, smartphone, and other web-connected devices in your home and your office. when online, remember to be thoughtful and to use polite language. sharing someone’s private personal information online, also known as ""doxxing,"" is never okay and may get you in legal trouble. don’t plug your mobile devices into any outlet you find. whether it’s a work or personal device, you could risk becoming the victim of juicejacking, a type of attack where ctas compromise public usb charging stations to infect unsuspecting users with malware or data theft. if you’re worried about running out of battery, bring a back-up power bank or charge your device using your own charging cable and a wall outlet. want even more tips to stay safe at home and at work?

https://nordlayer.com/learn/network-security/basics/,Network Security 101: Understanding the Basics,"every week, networks seem to grow in size and complexity. new saas services come online, while innovative communication tools make remote working easier. data storage methods shift, with new assets to secure. and newmalware threatsconstantly emerge. in an ever-changing digital world, network security has never been more crucial. network security is not a fixed constant. methods to protect networks change all the time. in this glossary article, we will explain network security basics. we will introduce the cia concept, and we will also look at contemporary security techniques. this article overviews the topic, but you can fine-tune your knowledge with detailed texts about related concepts. networks are collections of devices and applications. when linked together, these assets serve core business functions. network managers can place devices on different network segments, while they may also be geographically distant. but they are allpart of the same workstations, servers, switches, and saas gateways community. networks come in a variety of types. security measures required vary depending on network configurations. common variants include: networks operate atlevel 3 of theosi model. the network layer is where data is transmitted. servers create packets of information, which they send to network devices via routing devices. packets are then rendered readable at the other end. numerical ip addresses usually identify network devices. but more advanced network architecture uses text labels for the same purpose. systems may also apply encryption to data passing over the network. encryption conceals the contents of packets, protecting them against external observers. network devices are any items of hardware connected to the network architecture. every network should be documented and mapped. mapping enables managers to understand which devices require protection. company networks generally rely on several device types: monitoring tools track traffic and user behavior inside the network perimeter. it also checks the status of network devices such as servers or switches and informs network managers when faults occur. monitoring can bereactive or proactive.proactive monitoring is preferable, anticipating problems and seeking threats before they cause damage. monitoring can also be agent-based or agentless: this form of monitoringinstalls software agents on every network client. agents connect to centralized monitoring software. they provide a stream of data about the status of the device. this data could include memory usage and processes running on the device. agents may track user connections or assess general performance. agent-based monitoring delivers granular information and enhancesnetwork visibility. however, the proliferation of agents poses problems. security teams must set aside time to update and log agents. managing large communities of agents can be difficult for smaller organizations. this type of monitoringfocuses on data passing across external and internal network connections. it involves packet inspection to discover information about data and network usage. and it can also involve app monitoring to ensure only authenticated users have access. agentless monitoring is non-intrusive and requires few resources. it provides a data stream that can be used to improve security setups. but this information is generally not granular. network managers may lack complete awareness of threats. monitoring is not always constant. instead, security managersschedule inspections of digital assetsto assess functionality and security status. the gap between security inspections is the monitoring interval. intervals vary depending on device type and situation. technicians schedule constant inspections of the internal network. however, general network performance measurements may have longer monitoring intervals. this reduces the load placed on the network. network security is the process ofprotecting networks against potential threats. it includes software and hardware designed to detect and block malicious agents. securing networks also extends to access control, network organization, and security policies. networking security isclosely related to cybersecurity and information security. cybersecurity guards against digital threats. infosec focuses on data protection. both feed into protecting a single computer connected to the network infrastructure against outside threats. network security matters becausedata and apps need protection. businesses depend on reliable access to workloads and databases. however, they must secure confidential data from external observers via information security techniques. a well-thought-out security strategy balances access and protection while also meeting compliance goals. there are several networking security policy ingredients. common approaches include: levels of control make securing networks easier to understand. there are three control levels. companies should factor them all into their security strategies: administrative controls secure physical devices with multiple credentials for access safeguard data flow within the computer network manage user behavior through identity and access management systems locks and access controls protect servers and data storage devices protect data on network devices, including servers and workstations define user privileges with security policies enhance security with cameras and biometric scanners cover both locally connected and remote working devices onboard new employees and remove obsolete accounts to prevent credential theft ensure security without compromising network performance provide staff training to address security challenges the cia model is the most popular way of visualizing security methods for modern networks. this model is the basis for defense-in-depth, which means defending connected assets across all network layers. “cia” refers to the initials of the model’s core principles. these ideas include: network managers must enforce all three cia principles across the entire network. in practice, this means using several of the networking security approaches mentioned above. for example, traffic monitoring identifies which users access specific apps at a given moment. but it also means employing the right tools to achieve the cia triad model. the exact mixture of tools varies, but popular security options include: a load balancer uses algorithms to determine traffic flows across the network. traffic balancing helps to avoid bottlenecks but also has cybersecurity benefits. for example, load balancers can divert traffic when a service attack (orddos) occurs. a sandbox operates alongside ips tools to block aggressive malware actively. sandboxes create emulated environments. these environments assess network traffic and can identify attack techniques like port scanning that other scanners often miss. network traffic analysis tools use ai to analyze network traffic. they compare real-time traffic to secure baselines. baseline comparison allows traffic analysis tools to detect anomalies and report attacks before they cause harm. robust networking security is the key to preventing data breaches and ransomware attacks. follow the cia model to create a comprehensive security strategy. take into account physical, administrative, and technical controls. and choose agent or agentless monitoring to ensure total awareness.",1045
https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-network-security,What Is Network Security? Definition and Types | Fortinet,"discover the types of network security and how it can help secure your networks. network security refers to the technologies, policies, people, and procedures that defend any communication infrastructure from cyberattacks, unauthorized access, and data loss, while upholding the principles of thecia triad.in addition to the network itself, they also secure traffic and network-accessible assets at both thenetwork edgeand inside the perimeter. digital acceleration paved the way for business efficiencies, cost reductions, and productivity improvements. yet, it has also led to an expanded attack surface across the growing network edge. from local area networks (lan) and wide area networks (wan) to theinternet of things (iot)and cloud computing, each new deployment results in another potential vulnerability. worse yet, increasingly sophisticated cybercriminals are exploiting network vulnerabilities at an alarming rate.malware, ransomware,distributed denial-of-service(ddos) attacks, and countless other threats are challenging it teams to fortify their defenses. in turn, enterprises have much to gain by strengthening their network protections: hardware plays a vital role in securing the infrastructure. three devices, in particular, are relevant to network security: network security solutions to stay ahead of cyberthreats discover key network security components to achieve secure digital acceleration. afirewallis a device that monitors, filters, and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. acting as a barrier between trusted internal and untrusted external networks, it works by inspecting data packets and choosing to block or allow them. for example, a financial institution might configure its firewall to block traffic coming from unauthorized ip addresses while still allowing legitimate traffic to pass through. this mitigates a potential breach without interrupting core operations. next-generation firewall (ngfw) is a modern iteration that goes beyond traditional solutions, incorporating deeper packet inspection for more robust protection. ngfws often package many essential network security capabilities into one comprehensive offering, including intrusion prevention, antivirus and file sandboxing, web and dns filtering, and more. with a hybrid mesh architecture — firewall’s next evolution — organizations can centralize control and visibility of formerly disparate tools. this makes it easier to coordinate and control policies across on-premise and cloud-based firewalls, not to mention multiple branches and campus locations. 2. intrusion prevention systems (ips) intrusion prevention systemsdetect and block known and suspected threats before they can impact the network core or devices at its edge. in addition to north/south and east/west deep packet inspection, including inspection of encrypted traffic, they can also provide virtual patching, which mitigates vulnerabilities at the network level. using an ips, organizations can rapidly detect attack signatures and abnormal behavior. the system automatically takes action to block malicious traffic while alerting administrators for further investigation. 3. antivirus and sandboxing antivirus andsandboxingtools are key to determining whether a file is malicious. while antivirus blocks known malware threats, sandboxing provides a safe environment to analyze suspicious files. let’s say a user downloads a file from an email attachment. the antivirus software scans it for known attack signatures and behaviors. if it’s a confirmed threat, the software quarantines or removes the file. for an unknown file, sandboxing isolates it into a protected space where it can be tested to determine if it’s malicious. some security vendors are leveraging these capabilities in concert with ai, allowing them to perform sub-second analysis of never-before-seen threats. 4. web and dns filtering domain name system (dns) filtering allows organizations to stop domain-based attacks, such as dns hijacking, tunneling, etc. likewise, url filtering prevents users and applications from accessing suspicious urls, which could be linked to malicious websites. theseweb security toolshelp enterprises enforce acceptable-use policies while protecting them from harmful content. for instance, if a user attempts to access a malicious website, the web filter checks its database of categorized sites. if the domain has been flagged, it’ll block access entirely. 5. attack surface management some firewall solutions now includecyber asset attack surface managementtools that can help organizations automatically identify network it, ot, and iot assets, and assess those assets for potential risks. the tools can also assess existing security infrastructure and controls for misconfigurations and less-than-optimal settings that can then be updated to strengthen an organization’s security posture. 6. remote access vpns remote access vpnsallow users to securely access the corporate network from outside their organization’s office. they create a private, encrypted connection from a public wi-fi network, enabling employees to safely use critical resources from their personal devices regardless of location. these solutions are especially useful in hybrid work environments, allowing remote workers to stay productive with the assurance their data is safe from malicious interception. 7. network access control (nac) network access controlgoverns access to the network, ensuring that only authorized and compliant devices gain entry. nac solutions identify and authenticate devices, granting access only if they meet predefined compliance policies. for example, enterprises might configure their nac to block certain device types. this prevents users from accessing the network on unprotected personal devices, but it also can help the company manage iot andoperational technology(ot) deployments. hardware that fails to meet the criteria may be quarantined, redirected to a remediation network, or denied entirely. although not directly supporting the network, there arerelated cybersecurity technologiesthat help protect the infrastructure: application programming interfaces (apis) allow open-architecture casbs to directly integrate with saas providers. this enables admins to scan cloud configurations, ensuring their users are monitored and protected no matter what device they’re using. here are the five key benefits of network security. network security protects sensitive data, such as personal data, intellectual property, customer details, financial records, and more, from cyber threats like malware, ransomware, and phishing. robust network security minimizes downtime and ensures the business remains operational and resilient against cyberattacks. effective network security ensures that organizations remain compliant with regulatory frameworks like the general data protection regulation (gdpr) and the payment card industry data security standard (pci dss). this reduces the risk of legal fines and penalties. network security strengthens access control and authentication, ensuring only authorized employees can access sensitive data and minimizing the risk of insider threats. commitment to protecting sensitive organizational and client data can enhance a business’s reputation and build trust with partners. the top challenges in network security are: the rise in new technology and platforms has expanded the attack surface, providing hackers with multiple points to access an organization’s network. in the context ofcyber warfare, these expanded vulnerabilities can be exploited by nation-state actors to target critical infrastructure and disrupt essential services. while bring-your-own-device (byod) policies and remote work have blurred traditional location and network boundaries, they have also introduced new vulnerabilities. for instance, employees’ devices may lack robust network security controls, which can expose data over unsecured networks. the complexity of modern networks, especially with the growing use of cloud environments, and human errors can result in misconfigurations, leading to security gaps and cyber attacks. uncontrolled admin access can increase the risk of insider threats and data breaches. therefore, organizations must monitor user activity and manage privileged access to prevent misuse. network security in inherently more complex in larger, more complicated it environments. fortunately, there are several solutions fit for network protection at scale: modernsecurity operations centers (soc)require a centralized approach to event management. without it, they lack the context or visibility to protect the organization effectively. siem solutionsprovide a unified view of security across the enterprise, collecting information from network, endpoint, cloud, and other security products. they also offer behavior-based ai-powered threat detection, investigation, compliance reporting, and more. in short, siem reduces the complexity of managing network and security operations. ndr monitors internal network traffic, baselining normal behaviors and using machine learning (ml) and other analytics to detect malware, malicious traffic, and abnormal patterns that may indicate an attacker within the network. it also provides a robust capability to investigate and take immediate action on verified alerts. xdr streamlines threat detection and response across an enterprise's security ecosystem. by consolidating data from endpoints, networks, emails, and the cloud, it identifies and links suspicious activities that individual tools might miss. this integrated approach enables quick investigation and remediation of alerts or multi-step incidents through automated and manual actions. leveraging endpoint detection and response (edr) capabilities, xdr provides endpoint agents, telemetry, and endpoint blocking to effectively manage challenges while enhancing threat detection and response capabilities. the progression from endpoint detection and response (edr) to managed detection and response (mdr) to extended detection and response (xdr) follows the path of digital acceleration with ever-expanding attack surfaces and a hybrid workforce. essentially, the difference between edr, mdr, and xdr are as follows: today, network edges are anywhere the user connects and businesses may not be able to extend security everywhere it’s needed.managed security service providers (mssps)can help fill the gap with the critical expertise and infrastructure required immediately, at less cost. for example, amanaged detection and response(mdr) service can be a great choice for smbs that need enterprise-grade threat monitoring and response but find it too expensive to build or staff internally. larger organizations who need more comprehensive protection of a distributed environment and don’t have the resources in house, can choose anxdr servicefor cross-layered detection and response. xdr collects, normalizes, and then correlates data over a variety of security layers, including endpoints, firewalls, email, servers, cloud workloads, and the general network. mdr is a fully managed threat detection and response service delivered by an outsourced mssp. with mdr services, security teams can enhance their ability to rapidly detect, investigate, and respond to unauthorized and/or suspicious activity. some mdr services also offerthreat huntingand recommendations for improving overall security posture. some mssps also extend mdr with xdr which monitors, detects and analyzes security signals across endpoints, network, cloud, siem and email security systems. xdr is a new, alternative approach to traditional detection andincident response, integrating detection and response procedures across multiple environments to reduce the mean time to detect and repair attacks. xdr is a natural extension of edr suitable for organizations that have complex it environments or are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. xdr is highly scalable, supports multiple data sources, and ensures end-to-end protection of an organization’s attack surfaces. a typical in-house security operations center (soc) requires a dedicated staff of security engineers and analysts and the tools to support their work. the high cost of running a soc in house compounded by the shortage of cybersecurity talent and the burnout that often transpires, leads many organizations to choose a managedsoc-as-a-service(socaas). this allows them to outsource threat hunting, monitoring, detection, and remediation to an mdr or mxdr service provider with the cybersecurity experience, infrastructure, and tools, to actively monitor customers’ threat surfaces 24/7. cloud security is a shared responsibility. in general, the public cloud infrastructure is secured by the service provider—such as aws, azure, or gcp—and the workloads running on the infrastructure are secured by the customer. to meet the business imperative of cloud migration, organizations need a network security solution in the cloud that offers advanced protection, flexibility, and predictable costs. however, organizations that are accelerating their cloud adoption may not have theresources, skills, or time to build, scale, or adapt their cloud security to meet the pace of their business. a managed firewall serviceallows organizations to offload cloud security infrastructure maintenance, get deep visibility, apply robust controls, and optimize cloud security spend. a cloud-native,managed firewall serviceremoves the heavy lifting around network security operations and provides a frictionless experience to help customers easily deploy enterprise-grade security on the public cloud. cloud migration requires organizations to secure key cloud services. a next-generation,managed firewall serviceor network firewall-as-a-service (fwaas) simplifies security management with full visibility across environments and broad protection across cloud workloads and applications. whether a managed firewall service or a network fwaas, it is critical that organizations ensure that their public cloud workloads are protected by next-generation security solutions powered by comprehensive threat intelligence. with bad actors increasingly using generative pre-trained transformers (gpt) and otherai technologiesto create new, more compelling exploits and threats faster than ever, security teams must also leverage ai technologies to fight fire with fire. ai-powered threat intelligence is arguably the most important use case, as it can help organizations remain in lockstep with emerging threats. that’s why cybersecurity vendors, including fortinet, are escalating their ai capabilities. to stay ahead of the curve, it leaders should ask their providers how they’re applying ai, what technologies their ai tools use, and most importantly, how their applications contribute to one or more of the benefits below: cloud workload security signifies the security of data, applications, and all the infrastructure in cloud environments. it is a leading trend in next-gen network security because of the increasing usage of cloud applications. organizations are transitioning to the cloud and prioritizing visibility, risk mitigation, and integration with devops to ensure secure distributed workloads across containers, virtual machines, and serverless environments. cloud workload security helps them achieve the goal by providing real-time threat detection and continuous network security without impacting performance. mobile devices have become a vital part of everyday work, and therefore, organizations are focusing on security trends like building mobile security policies. the goal is to create a secure work environment, even when employees access data through mobile devices. organizations are offering employee training and leveraging mobile device management tools to monitor and secure devices. moreover, they are creating and teaching employees the best practices for protecting sensitive data and reducing risks associated with mobile device use. hybrid it network environments include multiple threat surfaces by combining on-premises equipment at corporate sites, cloud environments, and remote access by work-from-anywhere users—all of which add complexity to network security management. to solve this problem, ahybrid mesh firewalladdresses network security with a unified security platform that provides coordinated protection across multiple areas of enterprise it, to secure corporate sites such as branches, campuses, and data centers; public and private clouds; and remote access points. to do this, hybrid mesh firewalls come in various form factors, including appliances, virtual machines, cloud-native firewalls, and firewall-as-a-service (fwaas). sd-wan provides secure, reliable connectivity between branch and remote locations.secure sd-wanextends that protection to cloud-first, security-sensitive, global enterprises, and their hybrid workforces. using one operating system, secure sd-wan consolidates functions across sd-wan, next-generation firewall (ngfw), advanced routing, andztna application gatewayto simplify management and secure networking while enabling organizations to implement a robustsd-wan security architecturefor comprehensive protection. secure sd-wan is the foundation for a seamless transition to sase and sd-branch. it enables organizations to protect their investment and simplify operations along their journey to a zero trust architecture. a secure access service edge (sase)architectureconverges networking and several cloud-delivered secure service edge solutions to protect distributed networks with advanced cybersecurity at every endpoint/edge. sd-wan is the networking component and fwaas,swg, casb, and ztna comprise the edge security of sase. the advantage of a sase architecture is that it provides users with secure connections without the latency that results from backlogging traffic all the way to the central data center. aunified sasesolution seamlessly integrates essential networking and security technologies delivered via the cloud. it ensures secure access for hybrid workers and safeguards applications and data on any cloud. a single operating system unifies thesase componentsenabling seamless and complete convergence of networking and security. unifed sase secures access to the internet, corporate resources, and saas applications no matter the users or resources locations. according to the national institute of standards and technology (nist), azero trust architecture(zta) uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and workflows. zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). authentication and authorization (of both subject and device) are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is established. zero trust is a response to enterprise network trends that include remote users, bring your own device(byod), iot, and cloud-based assets that are not located within an enterprise-owned network boundary. zero trust focuses on protecting resources (assets, services, workflows, network accounts, etc.), not network segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource. ztna is a capability that controls access to applications. it extends the principles of zta to verify users and devices before every application session. ztna confirms that they meet the organization’s policy before they can access that application. however, ztna may work differently, depending on where a user is located, meaning that access to applications or networks may work from one location but fail from another. in contrast,universal ztnaenables secure connections regardless of the location of the network or user. users can work from anywhere, and administrators can apply zero-trust principles without having to worry about the quality of network connections. universal ztna improves security and connectivity regardless of where users are located—on-premise or remote, or the type of network architecture. stay ahead with ai-powered, next-gen network security solutions designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate cyber threats in real-time.fortify your network with fortinet today. here are the top eight best practices for network security regular security audits help organizations identify and detect vulnerabilities before they escalate, keeping network infrastructure secure. dividing the network into small, multiple segments enables granular control over data flow and access. this reduces the attack surface and contains potential damage within isolated segments. implementing mfa, which adds an extra verification step before granting access, combined with strong passwords, can reduce unauthorized access and strengthen network security. vpns encrypt traffic between remote users and the network, establishing secure connections and safeguarding sensitive data over the internet. the zero-trust security framework works on the principle of “never trust, always verify,” assuming no device is secure. it verifies each device in the network before granting access, thus minimizing the chances of breaches. a least privilege access policy limits users’ access and provides only the minimum level of access required to perform a job. this minimizes the attack surface, safeguarding sensitive data. implement strong encryption protocols and strict authentication policies, and continuously monitor the wireless network. according to thefortinet 2023 cloud security report, 43% of companies state that talent shortage is their biggest challenge in securing cloud workloads. so, it’s crucial to educate the employees about what is network security, how to identify cyberattacks like phishing and social engineering, and steps to take after an incident. network security defines an organization’s readiness to combat ever-evolving cyber threats and its seriousness to safeguard the integrity of its data and that of its customers from unauthorized access. the basic password encryption approach is no longer relevant and cannot prevent threats. statistareveals that data breaches are among the top concerns of company leaders. around 422.61 million data records were compromised in the third quarter of 2024. such incidents can damage a company’s reputation and lead to the loss of customer trust in the long term. therefore, implementing strong and advanced network security measures and tools is crucial to preventing these breaches and safeguarding sensitive data. fortinet’sfortigate next-generation firewall (ngfw)provides ai-driven threat intelligence for proactive defense and protection against cyber attacks. its purpose-built asics, called security processing units (spus), ensure fast-speed security processing, making fortigate a trustworthy and reliable solution for modern network security needs. connect with fortinet’s teamfor more details. vulnerabilities in your network security give hackers an opening to do untold damage to your network while exposing potentially sensitive and confidential information. network security protection has been developed to implement measures to protect your computer network's data from being lost, stolen, or manipulated. a computer network provides communication and enables the sharing of information to multiple users within a network. network security technologies work within several layers to protect your network as a whole against any potential threats. some of the common network security threats include phishing scams, malicious software (malware), and distributed denial of service (ddos). cybersecurity is a broader field that covers different security measures and threats, while network security is a specific subset focused on protecting the communication infrastructure and ensuring secure data transmission across networks. network security policies act as a framework for maintaining a secure network. they guide technical setups and user behavior to ensure the network remains protected from potential threats. please fill out the form and a knowledgeable representative will get in touch with you soon. by clicking submit you agree to thefortinet terms and conditions&.",3375

https://guardiandigital.com/resources/blog/guide-on-phishing,Phishing Threats Explained: Detection and Prevention Strategies.,"phishing attacks have shifted; it’s no longer about volume, it’s about precision. these sites may look harmless, but the emails delivering them still rely on a familiar formula. urgent language. faked sender details. links like these are designed to pass through security filters, and many do. that’s why protection against phishing attacks in 2025 takes more than awareness training. spotting red flags helps, but it’s not enough. you need to understand how phishing works now, how the tactics have changed, and why traditional defenses often miss them. email is still the most straightforward way in. these attacks can lead to wire fraud, credential theft, malware infections, or full-scale business email compromise. in this guide, we’ll break down how phishing attacks in emails work, the most common types targeting businesses, and the steps you can take to protect your users and your data. to our behind the shield newsletter. phishing attacks now account for over 22% of all cybercrime. in 2025, they're not just common, they're constant. thefbireceived 193,407 phishing-related complaints last year alone. it’s important to demystify phishing attacks to better understand how they work. phishing emails impersonate people you trust — vendors, coworkers, even your own boss — to get you to act before thinking. maybe hand over a password, open a file you weren’t expecting, or send money to the wrong place. most phishing campaigns are after sensitive information: financial details, login credentials, and company data. some attackers still send generic spam to thousands of people, but more are shifting to targeted emails that feel personal and credible. today’s phishing attacks often use social engineering, and in many cases, ai. messages are timed well, written clearly, and crafted to sound familiar. they don’t feel like scams. they feel like routine communication. that’s the trap. it works because it’s cheap, fast, and hard to trace for attackers; launching a campaign costs next to nothing. for the targets, the damage can be lasting, including stolen data, compromised systems, weeks of downtime, and real reputational harm. since 1987, phishing attacks have evolved into a set of highly targeted, professional-grade scams built to steal valuable data. some of the most pervasive modern types of phishing attacks include: want to know how to stopphishingattacks in emails before they reach your users? it starts with sharpening awareness and reinforcing habits that recognize the signs before they’re too late. spotting phishing is less about following a checklist and more about noticing when something doesn’t sit right. familiar habits, slowing down, reading carefully, and checking sources, are your first line of defense. the image below is a spear phishing email identified and quarantined by guardian digital engarde cloud email security. it closely mimics a legitimate fedex shipment confirmation email. can you spot the phish? some indications that this is a fraudulent email include the following: there is more than one way to protect yourself from phishing attacks. you need to be aware of your users and have a security stack that checks all the points. this includes scanning links and attachments in real time, catching attempts to impersonate others, checking senders (yes, spf and dmarc are still important), and keeping up with new threats as they appear. to prevent phishing attacks and scams in 2025, businesses need to combine training that you can do with tools that can change as threats do. think about more than just surface screens. think about finding malware, protecting against spoofing, and scanning that happens in real time. and your defenses need to stay just as smart as phishing techniques get smarter, especially since ai can now make fake websites and messages that look and feel real. sender behavior, message structure, and embedded link or attachment content are just a few of the indications that advanced phishing protection technologies look for. heuristic scanning, sandbox analysis, url reputation checks, and artificial intelligence are some of the methods they utilize to identify dangers that are typically missed by standard filters. these phishing protection tools work by analyzing multiple signals — not just content, but behavior, link structure, domain reputation, and spoofing indicators in real time. disconnect from the network, run a security scan, and alert your it or security team immediately. phishing attacks are so effective because they target the person, not the system. and while awareness is essential, protection against phishing attacks has to account for the moments when someone still clicks. some phishing attacks in your inbox will still get through. a convincing message, a fake login page, a well-timed request. that’s all it takes. you need defenses built around the user. real protection uses multiple controls working together. not just one filter. not just a warning banner. a strong email security platform can spot and block these threats as they happen. the good ones don’t wait for a signature update. they learn, adapt, and react in real time. prevention starts with seeing phishing attacks as a part of a system, not just a message. it is crucial to prioritize teamemail security training; strengthen your filters, and assume some attacks will get through. “engaging in email security best practices is important, but this alone will not prevent a successful phishing attack,” says guardian digital ceo dave wreski. “a fully integrated email security solution that delivers total end-to-end control is critical to safeguard business email accounts.” the right system doesn’t just block spam. it catches the sophisticated threats. the quiet attacks. the zero-day lures. and it keeps evolving as the threats do.",910

https://inspiredelearning.com/blog/phishing-protection-checklist/,Phishing Protection Checklist - Preventing Phishing,"bydavid bloxberg, senior global marketing manager, vipre security group phishing, pronounced like “fishing,” is a method cybercriminals use to steal personal information. it’s a widespread form of identity theft that can be difficult to detect. scammers often disguise their attempts as legitimate emails or websites, tricking individuals into sharing sensitive details. these include credit card numbers, social security numbers, login credentials, passwords, and phone numbers. to protect yourself, it’s crucial to approach unexpected emails and suspicious links cautiously and know how to respond if you accidentally engage in aphishing attempt. phishing attacks have become more sophisticated, making them one of the most effective tools for cybercriminals. today’sphishing emailsare often from trusted sources, like your bank or a well-known company. they can include professional logos, convincing email addresses, and even advanced html designs. this high level of professionalism can easily fool people into clicking on links that lead to fraudulent websites, where scammers steal sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers. one of the reasons phishing is so successful is that cybercriminals have evolved their tactics. in 2024, phishing attacks have expanded to target email users, mobile devices, and other communication platforms.according to recent reports: scammers also use advanced technologies, including ai, to craft highly personalized and convincing phishing messages. ai-generated phishing attempts can be difficult to spot because they mimic human language and behavior so well. this technological shift makes it more challenging than ever for individuals and organizations to detect and prevent attacks. in 2023, nearly 50% of professionals encountered business email compromise (bec) attacks, with35% of all cyberattacks resulting from bec phishing. these sophisticated attacks aim to steal login credentials or financial information and have resulted in substantial financial losses: in 2024, phishing attacks have also become more diverse. deceptive links remain the top strategy, accounting for 36% of phishing attempts, but attackers are now using multiple channels, including mobile apps and social media. notably, the use of ai in phishing has created convincing fake login pages and emails that are nearly impossible to distinguish from the real thing. the sheer volume and sophistication of phishing attacks make it a serious threat to businesses and individuals alike. as attackers continue to innovate with new tools and tactics, vigilance and updated cybersecurity practices are critical to staying ahead of these ever-evolving threats. understanding different phishing attacks can help businesses protect sensitive information and save money. you can gain peace of mind by guarding against cybercrimes and implementing phishing protection. it’s especially valuable for business owners—allowing you to focus time, energy, and resources on growing your company instead of dealing with security breaches. email remains a standard vehicle forphishing attacks. cybercriminals send mass emails, hoping even a few recipients will fall for their scams. with 30% of phishing emails being opened, the scale can be staggering if emails are sent to thousands or millions of users. spear phishingis a form of targeted phishing that involves detailed research. scammers gather information about a specific person’s contacts and customize a phishing email to make it appear as though it’s from a trusted colleague, friend, or family member. this personalization increases the likelihood of the victim sharingpersonally identifyable informationor clicking on malicious links. social media phishing occurs when scammers create fake profiles that mimic a user’s real friends. the attacker might send a new friend request, making it appear that the individual is starting over with a fresh account. this approach is designed to collect personal information or scam the victim’s contacts. smishinginvolves sending fraudulent messages via sms or text messaging. these messages often contain malicious links or ask for personal information, pretending to be from legitimate organizations such as banks or service providers. many users are unaware that phishing attempts can come through text, making this an increasingly common tactic. vishing uses phone callsto trick victims into revealing personal information or financial details. scammers often impersonate trusted institutions, like banks or government agencies, using urgency or fear to manipulate their targets. the lack of visual cues over the phone can make it easier for criminals to deceive their victims. whaling is a targeted phishing attackaimed at high-profile individuals, such as executives or government officials. the emails in whaling attacks are crafted to seem highly relevant and credible, often focusing on business or legal matters. the goal is to trick these high-value targets into transferring funds or disclosing sensitive information. zishing, a relatively new form of phishing, targets users of video conferencing platforms like zoom, microsoft teams, or google meet. in a zishing attack, scammers send fake meeting invitations or links to join a video call. these links often mimic legitimate meeting platforms, tricking victims into entering their login credentials or downloading malware. given the widespread adoption of virtual meetings, this method has become increasingly popular, as many users are less vigilant about verifying meeting invitations, especially during a busy workday. falling for a zishing scam can lead to compromised accounts and leaked sensitive information shared in virtual meetings. let the experts at inspired elearning help safeguard your organization

https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/networking/what-is-sd-wan.html,What Is SD-WAN? - Software-Defined WAN (SDWAN)  - Cisco,"the traditionalwan(wide-area network) function was to connect users at the branch or campus to applications hosted on servers in the data center. typically, dedicated multiprotocol label switching (mpls) circuits were used to help ensure security and reliable connectivity. this doesn't work in a cloud-centric world. times have changed. as businesses adopt the use of software-as-a-service (saas) and infrastructure-as-a-service (iaas) applications in multiple clouds, it is realizing that the user application experience is poor. that is because wans designed for a different era are not ready for the unprecedented explosion of wan traffic that cloud adoption brings. that traffic causes management complexity, application-performance unpredictability, and data vulnerability. further, opening the enterprise to the internet and the cloud exposes major threat and compliance issues. it is extremely challenging to protect the critical assets of an enterprise when applications are accessed by a diverse workforce, including employees, partners, contractors, vendors, and guests. enabling broadband on the wan makes the security requirements more acute, creating challenges for it in balancing user experience, security, and complexity. new business models drive the need for a new network model. sd-wan addresses the current it challenges. this new approach to network connectivity can lower operational costs and improve resource usage for multisite deployments. network administrators can use bandwidth more efficiently and can help ensure high levels of performance for critical applications without sacrificing security or data . also, since sd-wan unifies the entire wan backbone, it delivers comprehensive analytics across the network globally. this wasn't possible before, because of disparate pieces of infrastructure and policy. sd-wan can be seen as software defined networking (sdn) for the wan. it represents, arguably, the most popular and widely deployed use case in sdn. the sdn model became popular for abstracting network infrastructure in the data center and other sections within the enterprise perimeter. sd-wan played a similar role but needed to abstract infrastructure elements that were diverse in terms of link types, providers, and geographies. since it crossed the enterprise perimeter, it needed a robust security component as well. extend intent-based networking across the branch, wan, and cloud. for lean it teams, meraki simplifies branch management and integrates threat management.",359
https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/sd-wan-explained,What is SD-WAN (Software-Defined WAN)? Benefits and Components | Fortinet,"software-defined wide area networking provides secure, reliable connectivity between branch and remote locations. a software-defined wide area network (sd-wan) is a networking technology that leverages software-defined networking (sdn) principles to enhance wan performance. understanding thedifferences between sd-wan and sdncan help organizations choose the right architecture for their needs, ensuring both performance optimization and simplified management. sd-wans provide secure, reliable, and scalable connectivity across various locations while centralizing management and visibility over the network. thetraditional wan (wide-area network) functionwas to connect users at the branch or campus to applications hosted on servers in the data center. typically, dedicated mpls circuits were used to help ensure security and reliable connectivity. this has driven software-defined wan (sd-wan) solutions to become increasingly popular as organizations request fast, scalable, and flexible connectivity among different network environments. they also seek to lower the overall total cost of ownership (tco) while delivering enhanced application performance. but a subpar sd-wan approach can significantly inhibit an organization’s ability to quickly adapt to changing business demands, especially if it does not offer integrated security. sd-wan technology is important as it enhances network performance across wide area networks and offers better performance, increased security, and flexibility. sd-wans optimize data flow based on current network conditions, application needs, and pre-defined policies, allowing greater control without sacrificing performance or incurring high costs. the key benefit of sd-wan technology is that it can identify the best possible routes for traffic, and this simplification improves overall speed and service quality. sd-wan modernizes wan architecture by virtualizing connectivity. it intelligently routes traffic across multiple connection types, including mpls, broadband internet, and lte. this optimizes network performance and ensures reliable access to critical applications. sd-wan leverages a centralized control plane, simplifying network management. this software-defined architecture enables administrators to define and enforce policies across the entire network in real-time. learn more about thedifferences between sd-wan and sdn. security is also enhanced through integrated features like next-generation firewalls and intrusion prevention systems. this protects against evolving cyber threats and safeguards sensitive data. with sd-wan, businesses can achieve higher performance, improved security, and simplified management, all while loweringsd-wan costcompared to traditional wan approaches. in a nutshell, sd-wan is used for security. but what is sd-wan’s purpose when working towards specific business outcomes? sd-wan allows remote sites to connect more easily to networks, data centers, and/or multiple-clouds withlower latency, better performance, and more reliable connectivity. when users demand more of their applications and infrastructure at unprecedented agility and scale, an appealing user experience can be make-or-break. mpls and other connectivity technologies aren’t just outdated; they’re also more expensive when the total cost of ownership (tco) is considered. sd-wan not only significantly reduces bandwidth costs but can also help reduce capital costs by allowing consolidation of different point networking and security products at the edge while delivering better control and performance. as network infrastructures have evolved, the sprawl of point products used for networking and security increases complexity. sd-wan uses automation to make connectivity a simpler process across mixed environments, including on-premises, hybrid, and cloud. sd-wan enables centralized orchestration, zero-touch provisioning, and analytics along with deep integrations of cloud on-ramps to accelerate cloud connectivity. ansd-wan solutionneeds to have integrated security. otherwise, it’s just another connectivity option that unfortunately becomes an attack vector. when properly implemented, secure sd-wan enables private, secure and direct internet access. it’s critical that an sd-wan solution can ensure consistent security at all edges, from flexible wan edges to the cloud edge. watch this demo to see how fortimanager enables centralized management with automation-driven network configuration, visibility, and security policy management of

embedded firewall:an embedded firewall is directly integrated into the sd-wan device, providing essential security functions without the need for additional hardware. firewall embedded with sd-wan:this configuration tightly couples the firewall with the sd-wan functionality, enabling streamlined security policy management and enforcement. sd-wan with secure web gateway (swg):integrating sd-wan with asecure web gateway adds advanced threat protection and content filteringto control web traffic and prevent malicious activity. sd-wan with third-party firewall:this approach allows organizations to leverage their existing firewall investments while benefiting from sd-wan's connectivity and optimization capabilities. sd-wan offers an alternative to traditional wan architectures, delivering significant advantages in performance, security, and cost-efficiency. by intelligently routing traffic across a mix of connections like broadband internet, mpls, and lte, sd-wan optimizes network resources. this translates to faster application performance, improved productivity, and greater business agility. some of its key benefits are: sd-wan prioritizes business-critical applications, ensuring optimal performance and minimal latency. it dynamically adjusts traffic flows based on real-time network conditions, maximizing bandwidth utilization. this results in a smoother and more responsive experience for users, regardless of their location. sd-wan incorporates advanced security features like next-generation firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and secure web gateways. it enables secure segmentation of the network, isolating sensitive data and applications from potential threats. this comprehensive approach strengthens the security posture and protects againstevolving cyberattacks. sd-wan reduces reliance on expensive mpls circuits by leveraging cost-effective broadband internet connections. it optimizes bandwidth utilization, minimizing the need for costly upgrades. this leads to significant cost savings without compromising performance or security. sd-wan provides centralized control and visibility over the entire network, simplifying management and configuration. administrators can easily define and enforce policies, monitor performance, and troubleshoot issues from a single interface. this streamlines operations and reduces the burden on it staff. sd-wan allows businesses to easily scale their network up or down as needed, accommodating growth and changing demands. it supports a wide range of connectivity options, providing flexibility to adapt to different environments and requirements. this ensures the network can evolve with the business, supporting new initiatives and enabling digital transformation.to explore the

success is fully integrated security. without it, sd-wan becomes just another attack vector. asecure sd‑wan as a service modelis explicitly designed to interoperate as a single offering, ideally with each element running on the same operating system and managed using a single-pane-of-glass interface. this ensures that transactions are all seen and inspected, and any threats or anomalous behaviors are shared between every solution for maximum protection. as part of such an integrated monitoring system, the networking and connectivity functionalities of an sd-wan aren’t just more closely associated with the security solutions installed on the platform. they’re the same thing. deployment of security piecemeal is also unwise. because of the dynamic nature and high scalability of sd-wan, overlay security is not only very expensive to deploy and maintain, but often ends up with delays when reacting to connectivity changes, leaving critical connections and data vulnerable. an integrated system ensures that sd-wan connectivity, traffic management functions, and advanced security function as a single, holistic solution. an ngfw, whose key components include intrusion prevention (ips),web filtering, secure sockets layer (ssl) inspection, and anti-malware, is an example of an integrated solution. solutions that combine sd-wan andnext-generation firewall (ngfw) capabilitiesinto single offerings satisfy the key requirements for secure sd-wan—and ensure the safety and reliability of connections for the organization overall. for enterprises evaluating deployment models, reviewing essentialsd-wan security considerationshelps ensure that both performance and protection requirements are consistently met. as enterprises adopt remote workforce policies, networks grow more distributed. a new networking and security strategy is required that combines network and security functions with wan capabilities to support the dynamic, secure internet access for a “work from anywhere” global workforce. sd-wan plays a critical role in the adoption of emerging solutions like secure access service edge (sase) and enables flexible and consistent security across all edges.

advancement in network operations. by harnessing genai's capacity to learn from extensive datasets and produce valuable insights, organizations can optimize and expedite various phases of the sd-wan lifecycle. day 0 - simplified deployment:setting up an sd-wan traditionally involved complex configurations and manual interventions. genai can automate many of these tasks, analyzing network requirements and generating optimal configurations, thus reducing deployment time and minimizing errors. day 1 - intelligent operations:managing and optimizing an sd-wan network requires continuous monitoring and adjustments. genai can analyze network traffic patterns, identify potential bottlenecks, and suggest configuration changes in advance to maintain optimal performance. this intelligent automation reduces the burden on it teams and allows them to focus on strategic initiatives. day 2 - predictive scaling:as businesses grow and evolve, their network needs change. genai can analyze historical data and current trends to predict future network requirements, organizations can scale their sd-wan infrastructure in anticipation of future needs. this foresight helps prevent performance issues and keeps the network aligned with business objectives. incorporating genai into sd-wan management equips organizations to attain heightened agility, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. by automating routine tasks and providing intelligent insights, genai frees up it resources, reduces operational complexity, and allows businesses to focus on innovation and growth. in the modern business environment, where applications are vital, a smooth end-user experience becomes indispensable. by focusing on the end-user experience, organizations can maintain optimal application performance, leading to increased productivity, improved customer satisfaction, and a competitive advantage in the digital marketplace. a digital experience monitoring (dem) platform captures real-time data on user interactions with applications, offering insights into factors like latency,packet loss, and jitter. by correlating this data with sd-wan telemetry, organizations gain a comprehensive understanding of how network conditions affect the end-user experience. this deeper visibility allows it teams to: identify and troubleshoot performance issues:dem can pinpoint the root cause of slowdowns or disruptions, whether they originate in the network, the application, or the end-user device. prioritize remediation efforts:by understanding how performance issues affect users, it teams can prioritize addressing the most critical problems. optimize application delivery:dem data can be used to fine-tune sd-wan policies, guaranteeing that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth and prioritization. integrating dem with sd-wan shifts network management from a reactive to a proactive approach. by prioritizing the end-user experience, organizations can maintain optimal application performance, resulting in increased productivity, improved customer satisfaction, and a competitive edge. sd-wan allows remote sites to connect more easily to networks, data centers, and/or multiple-clouds with lower latency, better performance, and more reliable connectivity. the traditional wan (wide-area network) function was to connect users at the branch or

https://www.zscaler.com/resources/security-terms-glossary/what-is-zero-trust-network-access,Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) – Benefits & Overview | Zscaler,"/ what is zero trust network access (ztna)? zero trust network access (ztna) is a set of technologies that enable secure remote access to internal applications. trust is never granted implicitly, and access is granted on a need-to-know, least-privileged basis defined by granular policies. ztna gives users secure connectivity to private apps without placing them on the network or exposing apps to the internet. the future of work is distributed, and remote workforces and cloud workloads demand secure remote access. however, traditional remote access solutions likevirtual private networks (vpns)are not flexible or granular enough for distributed environments, increasing breach risks. this is a key reason65% of enterprises recently reported plans to replace their vpnswith a solution such as ztna. ztna providessecure remote accessto internal applications for any user, from anywhere, without putting critical resources at risk. to accomplish this, it starts with an architecture that's fundamentally different from a network-centric solution. relying on asoftware-defined perimeter (sdp), ztna enforces secure, identity-based access controls. this helps organizations replace their vpns while reducing dependence on tools like ddos protection, global load balancing, and firewalls. following four core principles, ztna: vpns give users access to a network and its resources through an encrypted, private tunnel. for many years, they were sufficient for users who worked remotely on occasion. however, cloud and remote work trends in the mid-to-late 2010s began to highlight shortcomings in the vpn approach. ztna provides secure least-privileged access. instead of granting trust based only on credentials, it verifies users based on a breadth of context, including device, location, and identity, for every access request. once verified, users receive direct application access rather than network-wide access. with vpns creating serious compliance and security risks, more and more organizations are discovering the advantages of ztna. here are some of the top reasons to make the switch: ztna helps organizations strengthen their overall security posture and agility by delivering: while ztna has many use cases, most organizations start with one of these four. vpns are inconvenient and slow for users, difficult to manage, and offer poor security.more than half of organizations cite security and poor user experiencesas the top challenges of vpn solutions. reduce third-party risk most third-party users receive overprivileged access, and they largely use unmanaged devices, both of which introduce risks. ztna significantly reduces third-party risk by never providing direct network access and enforcing least-privileged access to apps. accelerate m&a integration m&a integrations can span multiple years as organizations converge networks and deal with overlapping ips. ztna can provide direct app access with no need to converge networks or resolve ip overlap, significantly simplifying and speeding up m&a value capture. secure multicloud access securing hybrid and multicloud access is the most popular place for organizations to start their ztna journey. as more companies adopt the cloud, the vast majority are turning to ztna for security and access control for their multicloud strategies. how does ztna simplify multicloud access?ztna simplifies multicloud access by providing secure, direct connections between users and specific apps, wherever they are. it eliminates the need for complex network-level configurations or redundant vpns, using identity-based authentication and granular access controls to unify security across clouds. implementing ztna follows a phased approach designed to ensure smooth adoption, enhance security, and reduce risks: in today's crowded marketplace, it's important to consider several other key criteria when evaluating ztna solutions against your unique needs: keep these things in mind as you look forthe vendor that complements your goals and vision. zscaler private access™is the world’s most deployed ztna platform, built on the unique zscaler zero trust architecture. as a cloud native service, zpa can be deployed in hours to replace legacy vpns and remote access tools with a holistic zero trust platform. zscaler private access delivers: is ztna more secure than vpn? ztna is more secure than vpns because it gives access only to specific apps instead of entire networks. this reduces risks like lateral movement, hiding sensitive systems from attackers, and shrinking the attack surface for better protection. which industries need ztna the most? industries like healthcare, finance, and tech may gain the most from ztna. however, for any organization that depends on remote teams, strict rules, or large networks, ztna helps them keep data and apps safe with least-privileged access. how hard is ztna to deploy and manage? ztna is simple to set up and oversee. it works with cloud-based systems, so it deploys in days, not weeks. its portals offer quick control of policies, instant user insights, and easy scaling for growth. can ztna improve cybersecurity in hybrid work environments? ztna boosts security for hybrid work by limiting access to apps, stopping lateral movement, and changing policies based on device and location. it guards systems without slowing down or complicating user access. is ztna a good alternative to legacy network segmentation? ztna is ideal for replacing network segmentation. it uses identity-based app permissions instead of complex network setups, removing over-access risks while simplifying security for workflows and cloud setups. sd-wan vs. mpls: what's the difference?

month, forever, for free. however, you cannot keep your own fax number. whenever you expect to receive faxes, you can receive a temporary fax number from faxburner – this number will be yours to receive faxes on for 24 hours, and then you will have to receive a new (and different) temporary fax number. faxburner is not advised as a way of sending and receiving confidential or sensitive faxes – it is not hipaa compliant (even under its highest paid plan), and very little detail is provided about the security faxburner does offer, it doesn’t even claim to encrypt transmissions, which would make it less secure than the average online faxing service. what others are saying… faxburner has a very positive score on the apple store, with a 4.9/5rating. they also frequently respond to good and bad reviews in a unique and engaging way – we even found one bad review which led them to refund a customer’s annual charge because they locked themselves out of their account. people are generally very satisfied with using faxburner as a low-cost or free online fax option. if you’ll never need to send many faxes, but want a quick and easy way of occasionally being able to receive some – and you don’t mind the relatively low level of security – then faxburner’s free plan is one of the best value offers in all of online faxing. faxburner is a totally free way of receiving up to 25 regular fax pages each month. here’ss ourfull faxburner review faxzero is a free online fax service which can be used on a computer or mobile device. this is a totally free service which requires none of your personal information, or payment details – just verify your email address and you’re good to go. faxzero offers 5 free faxes per day, with a 3-pages limit on each fax, as well as an ‘almost free’ option which allows you to buy more faxes and send larger faxes. similar to gotfreefax, faxzero is totally free and only makes money from ads, so you aren’t getting the highest security here, and there is no hipaa compliance. you should only send faxes that are not confidential and sensitive using this service. on the plus side, faxzero are very committed to not sending you any spam or junk mail, and keep secure servers, and claim to delete your fax data 3 days after you send your fax. faxzero is well-liked by the tech industry as a basic free fax provider, with techradar giving it4-starsand pcmag giving it3-stars, the latter saying “if you refuse to pay for a fax, it’s the best option”. faxzero is a good alternative to gotfreefax, standing out for offering more free faxes, and for encouraging people to participate in politics. however, we wouldn’t recommend it above gotfreefax as an all-round fax service, due to the fax quality, branding, the inability to receive faxes, and some other factors. that said, it’s very useful as a free fax service if you need to quickly fire off a fax to a friend!read our faxzero review here. fax.plus is an online faxing service from alohi, and one of the top faxing apps on the apple and google play stores. as a paid subscription, fax.plus is a good choice, and they have a page on their website promising a simple process to send a free fax online. here’s the image quality for our fax.plus test: whilst fax.plus lacks the more advanced features of efax, it is still considered a very secure service to use, and a free trial includes the benefit of the security on offer. this is a safe service to send important documents with, however the free trial is not hipaa compliant (only fax.plus’ most expensive option provides this), and so we wouldn’t recommend using it to send or receive sensitive medical information, either to healthcare providers or insurance companies. fax.plus is a well-reviewed and leading online fax service, with a popularscore of 4.7on the apple store. it’s one of the leading faxing apps across multiple platforms, and consistently gets above average reviews. ultimately, fax.plus is a great service if you’re paying for it, however as a free fax service it does fall short compared to others. you only get 10 pages in total, and the website does lead you to think that the free service is more than 10 pages, only revealing the details once you have signed up. pamfax is an online fax service offering a free trial of sending 3 fax pages, with no payment details needed. you can then purchase a plan to get your own fax number, and start sending and receiving more faxes. in their , there is no mention of any advanced faxing security features such as e2e encryption, regulatory compliance, or data protection – just some very standard security features that most of the internet has. this is not recommended for faxing confidential information. we’re not the only ones underwhelmed by pamfax – techradar reviewed their paid service and gave it2.5 stars, finding that it missed key features and didn’t offer basic security features. pamfax is not a top suggestion when you search the internet for free faxing options, and we would suggest using an alternative. as we can see, there are a few half-decent ways to send a fax for free online, whether it’s no-strings attached, or a free trial you need to cancel after the fact. however, there are pretty clear limitations on the choices we could find: there’s also a few limitations they all have in common, one being page numbers – they all have a limit. the other limitation seems silly to say, but well,they’re free. this means you’re not a paying customer, so how can you expect to be treated like one? faxing usually involves very important, sensitive, and private information being sent in stressful times of life – filing your taxes, arranging healthcare, signing a will, etc., all still widely use faxing. you might be better off using a service which offers flexibility, security, and which treats its customers with the care they deserve. ultimately,you get what you pay for– take a look below at a side-by-side zoom-in between the fax from gotfreefax, andmunicorn’s fax app, a mainstay on the apple business charts as the most popular and well-reviewed fax app on the app store, with a 4.8/5 average from over 326,000 reviews. you can see the difference in detail, and clarity of the scan – you risk losing this important quality when using a free service. whenever you fax anything remotely important(which is anything i fax!), using municorn gives you the following things that free services just can’t offer: on top of that, municorn’s app also gives you a free test fax so that you can

digital marketing goals? high-quality content marketing can help companies amplify their overall marketing strategies without putting too much of a strain on budgets. cmi found that content marketing generates three times as many leads as traditional outbound marketing but costs62%less.use thesecontent marketing tipswhen building your content marketing strategy. in order to make your content marketing work for you, an adequate strategy will need to be established. it helps to take some time to brainstorm and think carefully about what you want from your content marketing efforts. do you want to raise awareness about your brand as a whole, or are you looking to highlight a new product or service? do you want to stand out as athought leaderin your industry and boost your competitive advantage? the answers to these questions will inspire your strategy and plan going forward.during your brainstorming andcontent ideationprocesses, take the time to develop achievable goals. every piece of content you produce should be based on research — meaning similar content has had a successful track record with others. but it is essential to keep in mind that your goals need to be attainable, not far-fetched and unrealistic. depending on your needs, some examples of content marketing goals can be: • improve revenue•generate great leads• increase conversions• boost brand awareness andauthoritywithin your industry’s niche• attract strategic partners• enhance yourcustomer engagement• build rapport with both new and returning customers• stand out within your local marketneed some inspiration? look at your competitors and other brands you admire to get some ideas for your content themes and formats. from there, create an editorial calendar to keep your content production consistent. learning about your audience is essential in making informed decisions about what content you create for your audience. it is all about meeting their needs and digging deep into their motivations, behaviors, challenges and goals. creating buyer personas or writing briefs can help facilitate this process. by conducting research, you will ultimately be able to createempathetic content marketingcampaigns that resonate with your audience on another level. before you start generating new content, you’ll want to take a look at the content you have already produced. you can use the fact that you already have content to your advantage. take a step back to examine what is already good about your content and what you can do to improve it.for example, are you active on social media, or do you have a blog with consistent and unique content? how are they performing, and do they get any interaction from your consumers? acontent auditdoesn’t have to be too challenging to complete, and chances are, you’ll already have a good idea of what is working for your brand and what is not.additionally, sometimes you may be able to pause new content creation and instead focus on refreshing older content. a simple content refresh or optimization can help breathe a new life into an existing piece of content, instead of having to draft up something brand new. you should target all the content you produce to the specific demographic you want to reach. remember that consumers want content they’ve never seen before. so, createunique contentthat consumers won’t be able to find anywhere else. plus, exclusivity is key. behind-the-scenes content, interviews with company members and product how-tos are wonderful options for standing out in the crowd.when creating your content, ask yourself the following questions:• what types of content would my ideal customer want to see? are they looking for product tutorials, informational guides or broader thought leadership pieces?• what kind of content will inspire consumers to keep coming back? are the customers more likely to react tovideos, blog posts or podcasts?• what sets your business apart from your competitors? what makes you different?• are there topics orcontent pieces i can outsourceto an industry expert or thought leader? the answers to these questions will help inspire your content creation process. in the realm of content marketing, evergreen content is content that is not time-sensitive. this type of content will always stay fresh, meaning it will always be relevant for your readers. there are plenty of benefits to investing in evergreen content, including:• providing a lot of value to audiences. the topics of evergreen content tend to stay relevant long after the initial publication date of the piece. no matter what season and year the reader finds the content, the information will be beneficial and informative.• continuing todrive trafficto the site months and years after publishing, since the piece still sparks interest and clicks.• the ability to be updated when needed because of industrytrends. this saves a lot of time for business owners in the long run, as they won’t have to constantly create new content.standard evergreen content formats include listicles, “tips and tricks” articles, informational how-to product videos, product reviews and videos.although evergreencontent articles provide valueto readers, prospects will also want to understand industry news and trends. bycurating newsfrom valuable sources or sharing expertise from the c-suite, companies can help their readers stay ahead of big shifts in their industry. a combination of these kinds of assets will help readers navigate best practices while demonstrating how new trends or developments in technology will influence their decision-making processes. remember that your overarching content marketing goal is to make sure you know your audience and what they want from you. creating andcurating the right mix of contentrequires a good understanding of the target audience and their pain points. for example, would your audience appreciate specific industry insights from trusted, third-party sources? or would it help to put your business in perspective by incorporating news stories and photography within yourcross-platform content strategy?personas, or detailed profiles of possible consumers, are a great tool for determining what would interest audiences. when brainstorming these personas, establish each target audience’s age, demographics, interests, jobs, income and lifestyle. since you will have many different potential consumers, you’ll need to have multiple audience personas. make sure you differentiate your content, either through the topic, format and presentation or through balancing a mix of original content andlicensed news articles, for each audience. this way, each persona is appropriately targeted. there are many free tools available online, such asgoogle analytics, that will give you a glimpse into your website’s performance. taking a regular look into yourwebsite’s contentperformance will help you see if your content is performing to the best of its ability, as well as guarantee that consumers can easily access it.search engines are run by algorithms, which dictate how search engines crawl, index and present your website’s information. these algorithms can change rapidly, and if your website is not technically sound, you may lose all the search engine optimization momentum you’ve already gained. so, it’s essential to use analytics to ensure that all your web pages are performing correctly.additionally, analytics can provide insight into well-performing content topics and themes. look at your content, and see which pieces got the most traffic, performed the best and created the most conversions. look at which headlines got the most clicks and pay attention to the length of time readers stayed on the page. take note of the common threads between your successful pieces of content and use this information to optimize both new and existing pieces. there is immensevalue in content marketing, but only if the content you create adds value to your audience. the content you are creating is paramount in answering your audience’s questions and building trust. deliver value by educating your audience through blogs, infographics, podcasts, and interviews. creatingstory-driven contenttends to perform better than authoritative content by positioning yourself as a curator of knowledge. diversifying your content strategy means creating different kinds of content and expanding the types of topics and themes covered in previous assets. you are more likely to keep your audience interested if you keep things fresh. the following are great ways to expand your content: demonstrating thought leadershipstarts with choosing the best content for your desired topic. if you are looking for content written by world-class writers and journalists,licensed contentcan help. using licensed content takes the hard work out of creating content that you know your audience will enjoy.with licensed content, business owners will:•save time:curating external content will increase your output while freeing up time to devote todeveloping your original content, start to finish.

https://copyblogger.com/content-marketing/,The Complete Content Marketing Guide For 2025 - Copyblogger,"content marketing is an excellent strategy to make potential customers aware of your brand. the ‘content’ in content marketing could be a video, blog post, podcast, or social media post. as most potential customers often do some preliminary research before purchasing products or services, they’ll likely find your content before making a purchase decision. if your content is helpful, those potential customers are more likely to trust your brand and buy your products or services when they’re ready to make a purchase. the problem is that not all content marketing strategies are equally effective. you need to know what problems your potential customers are searching, what makes a piece of content convert, which content platforms they’re using, and how to work with platform algorithms to get in front of your potential customers. to help you implement an effective content marketing strategy, here’s a complete content marketing guide for 2024. specifically, you’ll learn: our academy only costs one dollar to join for your first month. that means you can give it a try and learn a ton with zero risk. it was already the best place on the internet to learn content, copywriting, and online sales. now it’s extremely affordable to get in. we’ll make it $300+ eventually, so get in at a dollar while you still can. content marketing is a form of inbound marketing that attracts users to your brand by providing useful or entertaining content – usually in the form of text, video, or audio. content marketing is valuable to companies because it helps them build relationships and trust with their potential customers and existing customers at scale. as a result, it’s easier to sell your products faster. the roi of content is notoriously difficult to measure as it’s often just one step in the customer journey, but brands with strong content marketing strategies tend to have lower customer acquisition costs and generate compounding returns. content marketing also has a snowball effect, as those who use content marketing to build an audience see higher returns for each additional piece of content they publish. effective content marketing attracts people to your brand. you might publish a video, podcast episode, or blog post, and then people interested in the topic consume it and become acquainted with yourbrand voice. once you have that person’s attention, you can build a trusting relationship with them. as a result, you can sell them products and services. if you’re looking for content marketing andseo services, check out copyblogger’s agencydigital commerce partners. we specialize in delivering targeted organic traffic for profitable businesses. companies with excellent content marketing strategies have an unfair advantage over their competitors for several reasons. below we’ll discuss just a few of them. quality content creation isn’t cheap, but you’ll see a stronger roi from each piece of content you produce because your audience will grow. it’s a snowball effect. the first video, blog post, or social media post you publish might only be seen by a few people, but as more and more people find your content and become followers, each sequential piece of content you publish will be seen by more people and produce a stronger roi. so unlike paid ads, where you and your competitors can earn roughly the same roi for each dollar spent, brands with strong content marketing strategies and a large audience can earn significantly more for each piece of content published. another benefit of content marketing is that you can filter the type of customers you attract based on the content you produce. for example, if your target audience is exclusively cmos, you can discuss only topics that a cmo would be interested in, like hiring great talent. you might also offer access to exclusive reports on industry benchmarks that would interest a cmo. in contrast, paid ads force you to rely on the platforms to accurately identify your target audience. with privacy concerns on the rise and less accurate audience targeting, these platforms are producing lower returns. content marketing has a flywheel effect and produces higher returns over time – especially if you produce evergreen content. withevergreen content(content that is relevant for years), you can continue to generate returns from it even years after it was published. so even if you stop producing content for a period of time, you’ll still likely have a steady pipeline of leads thanks to your evergreen content. content marketing is essentially a cheat code to build trust with your potential customers at scale.the more they become familiar with your brand’s viewpoints and identity, the easier it is to trust your brand and the more likely they are to continue purchasing from your brand. content marketing can be any type of media across a variety of platforms, though the most common forms of content marketing include: below we’ll discuss each of these types of content in detail and when you should use them. blog posts are the bread and butter of the content marketing strategy for most b2b and even many b2c companies and local businesses.bloggingis valuable because it can help you rank in search engines for keywords that your ideal customers may search. for example, if you sell cro software, ranking first in google for the term “best cro software” will help you drive valuable leads because those searchers are clearly looking to purchase a product like yours. the process of optimizing blog posts to rank at the top of google is calledseo (search engine optimization). while blog posts are excellent at generating organic traffic to your website, effective marketers know that they need to also provide a next step to move the visitor through the buyer journey and eventually convert them into a customer.check out our guide to simple seo and content marketing. therefore, savvy content marketers often include a call to action in the blog posts to download a lead magnet, like a white paper or research study, in exchange for their email address. once you have a website visitor’s email address, you can retarget them with other valuable content to move them through your marketing funnel. another major benefit of long-form content like blog posts is that they often produce compounding results (assuming the content is evergreen or updated every few years). social media contentis excellent for generating brand awareness, and many brands (particularly those in the b2c space) rely heavily on social media for audience building. social media marketing is also becoming increasingly popular among b2b brands as more and more people turn to individual thought leaders for professional advice and industry news. linkedin’s revenue alone is an excellent reflection of the rise of b2b social media, as the platform grew26.2% in 2022to $14.5 billion – the highest percentage of growth it has seen in the past three years. the benefit of social media marketing is that you can develop relationships with your audience much more quickly, as it’s a very personal form of content marketing. the downside is that social media content isn’t evergreen, and the key to winning with social media marketing often comes down to publishing a high volume of high-quality content. this can be tricky as it’s important to publish high-quality content readers want to consume. video content is also becoming increasingly common in b2b and b2c content marketing strategies, as it’s now easier than ever to record a high-quality video on even a simple iphone. it’s also easier to quickly build a relationship with your audience if they can see and hear you, which is likely because body language makes it easier to trust a person. video content is also excellent for content repurposing, as you can turn a single video into podcast episodes, social media clips, emails, or blog posts. the downside with video content is that the best video content usually features a person, so it might not be a great option if there isn’t anyone within the company who enjoys being on camera. in addition, the person on camera will likely become the face of the brand. if that person later leaves the company, the audience might leave as well. there are more podcast listeners (and podcasters) than ever before. but even with the competition,starting a podcast is an effective way to grow your audience. when people hear your voice and stories repeatedly, it’s easy to quickly build a deeply loyal following. podcasts also have very high retention as, unlike other forms of content marketing, the audience can passively consume your content. so, unlike videos or blog posts that require the listener’s undivided attention, they might multitask while listening to your podcast. your podcast will also likely become part of that person’s routine, which makes the audience even stickier. for example, they might always listen to your podcast while driving to work or working out at the gym. like video content, the downside of podcast content is that you’ll likely lose your audience if the podcast host decides to leave your company. email marketingis arguably one of the best content formats because it’s the only platform you own entirely. email marketing is also an essential part ofe-commerce performance marketing. for example, a social media platform might change its algorithm, causing you to lose access to your audience, or a google algorithm update could cause your blog content to drop in the search results, and you’ll lose organic traffic. however, after someone gives you their email address, you own that list and can retarget them until they un because you aren’t at the mercy of a platform. another benefit of email marketing is that the people on your email list have demonstrated interest in your company by giving you their email addresses, making them higher-quality prospects. many content marketing efforts fail because they lack a solidcontent marketing strategyto attract the right prospects and nurture them through the buyer journey. if you randomly begin publishing content on different platforms without a thoughtful approach to which channels you’ll focus on, how you’ll position your brand, and how each piece of content moves the customer through the user journey, you’ll likely be disappointed by the roi from your content marketing efforts. to solve these problems, here’s a step-by-step approach tocreating a successful content marketing strategy. content marketing only works if you attract the right customer. otherwise, you’ll have low conversion rates or convert customers who are a poor fit for your product or service, creating unnecessary customer support headaches and high churn. to identify your ideal target customer, ask yourself these questions: once you answer those questions, you’ll have a good sense of your ideal buyer persona, and the rest of your content strategy will become clear. most customers don’t make a purchase the first time they visit your website, and that’s okay. content marketing aims to build a relationship with prospects toeventuallylead them to make a purchase. there are several stages of the content marketing funnel, from awareness (the customer is just learning about the pain point and potential solutions) to the purchase decision phase (the customer is solution aware and ready to purchase a product to solve the pain point). for example, if your product automates accounting processes, here’s what the customer journey might look like: creating content for each of these phases of the customer’s research process is important so that you can lead them through the funnel to ultimately purchase your product or service. if you pitch your product too soon, you can lose trust. yet if you never pitch your product, they’ll never convert. you’ll also notice that this marketing funnel has multiple different content formats. so how do you choose the best content format for your marketing funnel? it comes down to two variables: some audiences gravitate more towards specific platforms than others. for example, most people don’t go to tiktok to hire a lawyer or marketing agency. however, tiktok would be an excellent place to sell beauty products. the good news is that you can quickly identify the most effective platforms by analyzing your competitors’ platforms. even if you know that all of your competitors are producing video content, don’t try to create video content unless you know you can consistently publish high-quality video content. the key to winning with content marketing is consistency, so selecting a form of content you enjoy is important. now that you know what content you’ll produce, you can map out the top, middle, and bottom-of-funnel content. it’s also worth noting that you don’t necessarily need a different form of content for each funnel stage. for example, you can create tofu, mofu, and bofu content with just blog posts. the reason it’s important to map out your marketing funnel at this stage is to ensure you have a clear call to action at each step to move the visitor forward in the buyer journey. an effective content marketing plan is about more than just mapping out the types of content that it will take to produce. you have to actually have something unique and interesting to say to get people to pay attention to your content. so the next step is to figure out how to consistently generate content ideas that are unique and appealing to your ideal audience. we created an entire blog post ongenerating content ideas, but a simple framework you can use to consistently curate interesting content ideas is this: with the rise of ai writers flooding social platforms with “me-too” content, thought leadership content with a unique and contrarian viewpoint will continue to stand out, and you’ll actually find iteasierto build an audience. so before you publish any content, ask: if you can’t authentically say “yes” to both of those questions, don’t publish the content. if you consistently publish content with an authentic brand voice and don’t regurgitate the same ideas that have already been published, you’ll gain trust much more quickly, as people will look to you as an industry leader. your content marketing strategy will only scale if you publish new content consistently. in fact, the formula for a great content marketing strategy is pretty simple: if you do these three things, you’ll find that your content marketing strategy is highly effective. the problem is that most people give up too quickly or don’t publish consistently. as a result, the audience you build forgets about your content and you’ll have to restart the relationship from zero. the good news is that implementing a simplecontent calendarand workflow process can reduce inconsistencies. to get started, adopt a project management platform, liketrello,basecamp, orasana, and then break down each content marketing campaign into various tasks that you can assign to your marketing team members with due dates. here’s a great sample editorial calendar in trello: once you’ve created a workflow process, it’s pretty easy to then ensure each piece of content is published consistently. the final step is to measure your results. this is tricky as content marketing is a long-term play, and you probably won’t see any immediate returns on your investment. however, some earlycontent marketing metricsyou can track to make sure your strategy is heading in the right direction include: in addition to tracking these general brand kpis, be sure to also track specific campaigns so that you can assess what content performed the best and double down on producing more of those content formats and ideas. most marketers track the majority of their content marketing efforts in google analytics, though you can also use third-party tools like semrush or ahrefs to measure these metrics. the content marketing strategy established above is the process you need to get an effective content marketing program off the ground. once you have established systems and processes in place, here are a few more advanced content marketing tips to consider. audience research is important, but instead of just observing them from afar, interact with potential customers to learn more about their pain points and build genuine relationships. you can do this by joining slack groups, facebook groups, and other online communities to learn about the pain points these people face. for example, if you sell to airbnb hosts, this might be a great community to join. while you shouldn’t sell your products or services in these groups, you can answer questions and use members’ questions as inspiration for new content ideas. while content marketing should educate potential customers, it also does need to sell them at some point – otherwise it won’t be a profitable marketing strategy. the good news is that there is a way to tastefully pitch your product or service. here’s an excellent example. this blog post targets the keyword “how to create an online course” and the brand that published this blog post, learnworlds, is an online course platform. as you can see, one of the steps is learning where to host your course. they first provide several options such as self hosting and online course marketplaces: then, they provide a third option, which is using an online course platform like learnworlds. then, they explain how it works and specific features that you should know about. for someone executing the steps of creating an online course, this is helpful information and can drive conversions for the brand. the key to tastefully pitching your product/service is: most businesses don’t have the capacity to produce unique content for youtube, social media, the blog, and a podcast. the good news is that you don’t have to create unique content for each platform.content repurposingallows you to take one piece of content and rework it into different platforms. for example, if you have a long form video, you can take clips from it to post on social media and hire a writer to rework the video transcript into a blog post. this is a great example of content repurposing from the pilot institute. they published this video: then they converted it into a blog post: they also occasionally repurpose clips from their videos oninstagram: this allows you to reach more people as each potential customer has their own platform preferences. the key is to make sure that each piece of content is formatted to the platform. for example, hire a writer to rework the transcript into a blog post rather than just publishing it as a plain transcript. additionally, you can see that the clips posted on instagram from the pilot institute are well optimized for the instagram platform as each one has subtitles and the clips themselves are cut well for social media with each scene only lasting a second or two. many content marketers are excellent at attracting their ideal audience, though far fewer know how to keep them engaged and eventually convert those visitors into customers. unfortunately, if your customers never convert, your content marketing won’t be effective. to solve this problem, include a helpful resource, like a cheat sheet or a template that the audience can download. then, ask for their email address in exchange for the free download. once you have their email address, you can send them a nurture email sequence to continue remarketing to them and eventually convert them into a customer. hubspot is a master at capturing leads. for example, they have a guide on conversion rate optimization and then offer a cta to download a cro planning kit: when you click on “download the free planner,” they ask for your email address. once they have your email, they can remarket to you through email and eventually convert you into a customer. we already mentioned that analyzing your competitors’ content marketing strategies is a great way to get a basic understanding of what types of content and topics resonate with your audience. however, a pro content marketing tip is to analyze your competitors’ ads and use them as inspiration for yourorganiccontent marketing strategy. specifically, look at your competitors’ longest running ads as those are probably generating the most sales (otherwise, they would have stopped running them). to track your competitors ads, you can use a paid tool like ahrefs and look at the keywords they’re paying to rank for. these are all excellent keywords to write seo content for: you can also look at themeta ads libraryto analyze your competitors ads. it also tells you how long the ad has been running for, so take note of the ones that have been running the longest. linkedin also has anads libraryyou can use to track your competitors’ ads: for the first time, we’re bringing the copyblogger methodology to clients. as the agency/production arm of content marketing pioneer copyblogger,digital commerce partnersworks with you to deliver the prospects you need to succeed. we build profitable digital commerce products and businesses for ourselves and those we work with. for us, providing content marketing and seo services to clients was the last step, not the first. let’s explorehow we can help your business win. to inspire your content marketing strategy, here are a few excellent examples of outstanding content marketing. as one of the most popular seo tools on the market, it’s no surprise that ahrefs has plenty of in-depth blog posts with actionable information. from their detailed beginner’s guides to more specific blog posts around advanced seo topics, they always deliver original ideas with thought leadership authority. here’s an example of an original research blog post they wrote onhow long it takes to rankin google: they also tastefully pitch their product in many blog posts by showing readers how to use it to actionably solve the keyword they’re searching for with the product. while blog content isn’t typically a go-to form of content marketing in b2c, it can be an excellent tool for any product where education is necessary before the customer purchases. the company levels is a glucose monitor that does an excellent job of creating helpful and authoritative advice about glucose and healthcare. they do a great job of breaking down complex topics and have doctors and other authorities write/edit the posts to ensure they provide accurate information. so even if you’re in the b2c market, blog content might be a viable option depending on the customer journey. case study:here’s how we help add.org reach 114,548 more people per month (in a hyper-competitive market)using content marketing. gopro is one of very few companies that expertly leverages user-generated content. rather than just creating content themselves, they consistently run social media contests where users can submit their own content recorded on a gopro to win a new gopro. this kind of content performs incredibly well because, rather than just sharing a branded post, contestants share their best social media content with the gopro hashtag. as the content itself is already the creator’s very best work, it naturally earns tons of engagement, which multiplies the reach of the gopro hashtag. while gopro has an advantage as their audience is mostly creators, any brand can use the contest blueprint. instead of asking contestants to share a branded post, ask them to create their own content. b2b brands are beginning to realize that the best way to win on social media is to boost the executives’ presence. justin welsh is an excellent example of a b2b influencer who has amassed a substantial following by consistently publishing high quality content on twitter and linkedin. in fact, he now has an entire course on his process and the heart of his strategy is: even if you’re a member of the marketing team and trying to discover methods to level up the company’s brand awareness, building your own social media presence or the social media presence of executives is a great way to then communicate the brand’s messages to a loyal audience. most b2b brands assume that creating a video content marketing strategy means you must produce youtube video content. however, ocho is an excellent example of a brand that creates full video courses for its customers. they also collaborate with other industry influencers to create adjacent courses. for example, they collaborated with angel investors, tax strategists, and other experts who then helped them promote the content. this is an interesting youtube channel that covers everything you could possibly want to know about disney. unlike most consumer youtube channels that show off the creator’s personal life, the host, aj, never even shows her face on the channel and instead provides detailed descriptions of her experiences at various disney restaurants, theme parks, and hotels. she even has a team of people who go to various disney locations to try out different foods and rides and then report back to her to deliver authoritative content for the youtube channel. it’s an outstanding collection of truly expert insider tips that you can’t find elsewhere, and it’s packaged in well-organized videos (there’s usually a list of tips or rankings for each topic covered) that she narrates. this is also a very scalable business model as she doesn’t have to personally show her face or test out the various theme park amenities herself. my first million is a b2b podcast hosted by sam parr and shaan puri, both of whom have successfully built and sold multi-million dollar companies. however, the podcast is popular not just because they’re successful entrepreneurs, but because they deliver unique perspectives through entertaining stories that most people have never heard of before. with over 100,000 listeners, it’s one of the top business podcasts, but it’s actually owned by the hubspot podcast network. so even if you’re a b2b brand, you can elevate some of your executives to start a podcast and then use the ad space to promote your own company. this is a popular consumer podcast about relationships and dating that has succeeded largely thanks to the host’s entertaining stories about their personal experiences. they also have interesting guests on the podcast, though it’s their raw authentic stories that seem to keep the audience hooked. so if you have a podcast and are talking to a consumer audience, the best way to build trust and remain entertaining is sharing your own personal stories and being vulnerable about past experiences and challenges. the danny miranda show is only a few years old, though danny has interviewed some of the biggest content creators podcasters on the scene, including gary vaynerchuck, alex hormozi, and others. he also recently sat down with the team at copyblogger to discusshow to grow a successful podcast. while video and audio content is on the rise, text based content is still very popular and is still critical for blog writing, email marketing, and even a lot of social media content. so while there is adifference between copywriting and content marketing, many copywriters are content marketers and it’s a valuable skill to acquire. therefore, learninghow to be a copywriteris one of the fastest and most effective ways to improve the results of your content marketing. it’s the difference between a reader getting bored or frantically sharing your content with everyone they know. there’s no way i’ll be able to cover everything you need to know about copywriting in this blog post. it’s simply too broad and deep of a topic. however, i can share some of the essential elements of good copy that you can use to start improving your content right away. good copywriters know thatheadline writingis important. great writers obsess over their headlines. it’s the one thing that determines whether or not your content gets read. you could have the most incredible content in the world, but if your headline is boring or weak, it won’t matter. a good headline is clear, specific, and intriguing. it should both tell the reader what to expect while also teasing them about what’s inside. your headline should also qualify your reader, meaning that it should attract your target audience. if it’s too vague, a reader will start reading — thinking that the article applies to them — only to discover it has nothing to do with them. they’ll feel tricked. this is critical. you aren’t just trying to get anyone and everyone to click to read your article. that becomes meaningless. you want the right person reading your article, someone who you know will get value from it. so spend the extra minutes, hours, even days getting your headline right. copywriting is all aboutunderstanding the emotional and psychological state of the reader.you have to be able to get inside their heads and join the conversation. one way to do this is to write to someone very specific. this could be an avatar of your ideal customer that you’ve created, or it could be a real person who fits the bill of your target audience. either way, picture this person as you write. what do they struggle with? what are there experiences? how would you talk to them if you were sitting on the couch at a coffee shop together? once you’re clear on that, write to them. ignore all of your professionalism and grammar rules. just write like you’re there at the coffee shop with them, or like you’re writing an email to them. your writing will become more personal and you’ll form stronger connections with your readers, which is key tobuilding a loyal audience. they will feel like you’re talking right to them because you are, to some extent. that’s the kind of writing your audience will read, share, and buy from. one of the cardinal sins of copywriting is too much complexitythat makes your message confusing. good copy is all about breaking things down so that your reader can easily and quickly understand what you’re talking about. this means not using complicated words, insider speak, technical jargon, and long, perfectly structured sentences. that’s like a death warrant for your copy. instead, break up your sentences. state your point simply. find the easiest, simplest way to say what you’re trying to say. otherwise, your reader will have to work hard to sift through what you’re writing and get confused. as a result, they don’t do anything. they don’t read, they don’t share, they don’t buy, nothing. that’s not what you want. so keep your writing simple and to-the-point. hopefully you can see the value of content marketing, but if you want some additional proof that it’s one of the most effective long term marketing strategies, here are some statistics. yes, content marketing is effective as about62% of b2b buyerswill read at least 3-7 pieces of content before they’ll agree to talk to a salesperson, making content marketing essential for your marketing funnel. about73% of b2b marketersand 70% of b2c marketers incorporate content marketing into their overall digital marketing strategies. content marketing costs range, but about 39% of companies spend between $1,000 and $5,000 per month on content marketing, 33% spend over $5,000 per month on content marketing, and about 27% spend less than $1,000 per month on content marketing. a recentstudy by semrushbroke it down: in addition,most companies (69%)increased their content marketing budgets in 2023, while only 3% planned to decrease spend. according to data from statista, the most popular social media platform is facebook, withover 2.9 billion monthly active users. youtube is the second most popular social media platform with over2.5 billion monthly active users. surveys show that about93% of marketersworldwide use social media marketing in their business’s marketing strategy. according tostatistics from semrush, the most popular form ofcontent promotionis publishing organic social media content (73%). here’s a full breakdown of the most popular content promotion strategies: studies show that91% of companiesuse video marketing in their marketing strategies, which is the highest it’s ever been! yes, about77% of internet usersstill actively read blog content. statistics showthat 61.4% of marketers have used ai in at least one of their marketing campaigns, and 44.4% have used ai to aid their content creation process. for those who are not yet using ai, a lack of understanding of ai(41.9%)was cited as the top reason for not incorporating it into their workflow. paid costs continue to rise, and as targeting becomes less accurate due to privacy concerns, the roi of paid ads will likely continue to decline. therefore, it’s likely that more and more companies will invest in content marketing. in addition, the introduction of artificial intelligence, from ai content writing tools to ai video editing tools, has made it easier than ever before for any company to increase its content output. as the volume of content increases, b2b and b2c content consumers gravitate more toward content that reflects personal experiences and unique and original ideas. therefore, it’s likely that individual content creators will be critical to any brand’s content marketing strategy over the next several years. if you want

https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/insights/content-marketing-best-practices,40+ Content Marketing Best Practices in 2025 | Twilio,"content marketing best practices don't change too much from year to year, but it's always a good idea to check in every once in a while. sticking to tried-and-true tips and tactics will help maximize your time, efficiency, and output—it's worth a 5-minute read. content marketing—it's like trying to stand out at a rock concert while everyone else is shouting just as loud as you are. with millions of blog posts, videos, and social media updates flooding the internet daily, how do you make sure your content cuts through the noise? well, by following the latest-and-greatest content marketing best practices (of course). plus, we've collected all the tips and tactics into a single (downloadable) content marketing best practices checklist. you can find it at the bottom of this post, but resist the urge to skip to the end—you'll get the most benefit from digging in top-down. before we get into the content marketing best practices, let's get on the same page about why all this matters. content marketing isn't too complicated, right? create content, and people will come to consume it.not quite.take a look at these statistics: mind-boggling, right? with all that new content emerging daily, how in the world will your audience findyourcontent—and why should they?you have something special to share: something your audience needs. however, they'll never find it if you don't follow the content marketing best practices outlined below. here are a few ways content marketing best practices help improve your overall content program: while these content marketing best practices aren't necessarily in order of importance, it’s best to follow them sequentially. start at the top and work your way down. content marketing starts with your audience. start somewhere else, and you're destined to build amazing things that nobody wants—cheetos lip balm, anyone?first, choose the buyer persona you want to target. don't have that yet? start withlead nurturingand thecustomer lifecycle.your content strategies might target different audiences and buyer persona, and that's ok. just ensure you have a specific reader in mind when writing an article.take this blog post, for example. twilio sendgrid caters tomarketersanddevelopers. however, developers don't care much about content marketing best practices—that's why i wrote this for you, marketers. you likely have a fictional customer journey in mind for your customers: the customer reads your tweet, laughs, follows your brand, sees more content, then buys your product.in reality, it's rarely that straightforward (or linear).customer journey mapping helps you learn the real path your buyers take, from becoming completely unaware to brand ambassadors of your products.plus, customer journeys tend to follow the same stages: understanding what each stage looks like for your customers will help you make optimizations to improve it.don't have a customer journey yet?follow our how-to guide to get started. without a well-defined content marketing strategy, you're just throwing darts at the board and hoping something sticks. while that can score you some short-term wins, it's not a recipe for long-term success.successful content marketing campaigns start with a plan.you need a reliable, scalable strategy you can trust. and a solid content marketing plan ensures that every piece of content has a purpose and that every purpose aligns with a greater organizational goal.readhow to create a content marketing strategy in 11 stepsto start building your plan. top-notch content requires a world-class team, so focus on building a flexible, resilient content marketing team. find folks with a wide variety of specialties: don't be afraid to find freelancers and contractors to supplement your content needs. they can be great at filling skill gaps or keeping up with fluctuating demand. from the get-go—not later—you need to decide what business goals will be crucial to your team. you can't do everything, so gethyper-focused on a handful of metricsyou want to tackle: ensure your content aligns with your marketing goals—not the other way around. for example, content teams often make the mistake of coming up with ""good ideas"" before creating goals. this leads to amazing content that nobody wants or results your business doesn't need (or care about). before you start thinking of new content you want to create, take a look at your existing library. you'll likely find heaps of great articles, videos, and graphics that just need a bit of tender loving care to perform well.for example, you might find a 3,000-word blog post getting little-to-no traffic. identify keywords it might rank for on page 2 or 3 of google's search engine results pages (serps), and optimize it to try and rank for page 1. it'll take you 10% of the time of creating a new piece—and it’ll start ranking faster too. while auditing your existing content library, look for gaps. what potential topics have you not covered yet? do competitors create content you don't have?understanding your content gaps gives you an excellent place to start when researching new pieces. for example, do you lack how-to tutorials for your products? do you need a starter video for the onboarding process? you can likely repurpose every piece of content you create. whether an article, video, or podcast, there are dozens of ways you can repurpose your content in different formats.let's take a podcast, for example. here are a few ways you could repurpose a podcast episode: need more ways to repurpose content? we've got 20 of them. check out20 simple ways to repurpose content to boost your traffic. every piece of content you create can be multipurpose. for example, you might create a product-focused blog post about a new feature you're releasing. that's fine—your current audience will love that. however, you'll likely need to optimize this piece for search engines if you ever want anyone outside your existing customers to learn about it.get comfortable doing basic keyword research and finding your users' search queries. basic seo best practices can take your content the extra mile. sometimes, content teams get stuck in a rut of producing the same content, whether blog posts, guides, or social media campaigns. think outside the box and branch out. there's a whole wide world ofcontent opportunities—experiment every once in a while to see if something clicks.here's a quick list of different content formats you could produce: your site's backlinks and domain authority will impact how well it ranks on serps. fortunately, content creation and backlink building go hand in hand. look for ways to use content to create high-quality backlinks.here are a few content-creation strategies for building backlinks: when you find something that works, scale it. for example, if you have a handful of articles that outperform all the rest (which is often the case), decipher any similarities and what makes them perform well.do the articles follow a certain format? does the writing center on specific topics?once you find the keys to success,turn them into a replicable template. for example, you might discover listicles perform best on your website or find top-of-funnel ""what is"" content works best.scale your successes and juice them for all you can. a content calendar (or even an editorial calendar) will keep your content production and publishing schedule on track. managing handfuls of writers and projects simultaneously can get messy—especially if you don't use a task management system.without a content calendar, you'll end up with some weeks where you publish an overwhelming amount of content and others that experience content droughts. you want consistency.a content calendar ensures every new piece of content gets the time and space it deserves. that means you might publish 1 piece every day or 2 a week. use a content calendar to stick to whatever cadence you decide on. you want the content you create to solve problems. think about questions your customers might have or issues your products help solve. once you identify the pain point, solve it with content.your solution might not always be the primary answer, and that's ok. for example, if you sell fitness equipment, you might create motivational content to inspire your community to work out.orif you sell email services, you might create content marketing best practice articles to help your customers understand how email works together with content marketing.see what i did there? content teams get pressured to create, create, create. with a never-ending to-do list, getting pulled into the publish, publish, publish mindset is easy. however, it's vital to take a step back every once in a while and ask: questions like these will help you discover if your content is valuable or just busy work. frequencyisn't so much about quality over quantity (though we'll get into that soon). it’s more about how often you publish on different channels.more (even if it's quality) isn't always better.for example, your customers might love your monthly email newsletter, but thatdoesn'tmean they'd love it more as a weekly newsletter. the same goes with any medium. just because you can publish a youtube video every day doesn't mean you should.your audience leads busy lives. they have work, family, and personal ambitions to go after. keep that in mind when you produce content. don't overwhelm your customers to the point where they can't consume all your content (even if they want to). believe it or not, noteveryonewants to consume your content. shocking, right? yet, they won't always get to choose, especially when you use traditional media, video advertisements, or pay-per-click ads to get in front of them.however, on channels they do get to choose, ensure you get permission before marketing to them. for example, email andsmsare opt-in marketing channels. just because you have your customer's email address from a purchase order or delivery update request doesn't mean you have permission to send them marketing messages.they need to give you ""unambiguous consent.""followthese opt-in optionsto learn more about getting rs (the right way). also, brush up ongeneral data protection regulation (gdpr)laws to ensure your email program is compliant. content marketing is an ever-changing field. trends come and go, algorithms change, and new channels flare up and perish months later. it's up to you to stay on top of things to capitalize on shifts.i remember when i started listening to podcasts about 8 years ago. even then, i thought i had already missed the podcast bandwagon—and look where we are now. even if it doesn't go according to plan, don’t be afraid to try a new tactic and channel—it's a learning experience. plus, it's a solid excuse to secure your brand's name and tag on possible digital channels.you might think a channel might not align with your brand, but you'd be surprised. just about any company can find success on platforms ranging from instagram to tiktok to reddit. there's a good chance your audience uses these different platforms, and that means there's an opportunity for you to reach them there.the challenge comes from creating relevant content for each channel that your audiencewants. that's no small feat (and definitely beyond the scope of this article).here are a few channels to consider experimenting with (if you haven't already): good content doesn't get the love it deserves if the user experience (ux) suffers. everything from your site's user interface (ui) to the page's color scheme to accessibility concerns can impact the user experience, and it's a shame when these elements destroy quality content.work with your ui/ux team to improve these factors on your website. test how different layouts affect bounce rates and completion rates. then, keep working to improve your content's experience to increase the likelihood that customers consume, enjoy, and share it. i told you we'd get here eventually. when it comes to content, quality is always better than quantity. often, you don't need 5 small blog posts—you just need one big comprehensive one.the same is true for almost all content you produce. don't worry about how much of it you create—instead, measure each piece's impact.push back against management if they set content creation goals.content creationisn't your end goal—it's results. and who cares if you drive results with 3 videos or 15 videos? while it’s cool to jump on new trends, never forget about evergreen content. evergreen content is always relevant. it might not get increased attention or features in headlines, but it's something your audience will always want.let's look at email, for example. right now, everyone cares about artificial intelligence (ai) assisting with email creation. that's fine and relevant, but do you know what email marketers willalwayssearch for? interest in topics likeai-based email marketingandbrand indicators for message identification (bimi)will rise and fall, but evergreen topics will always be important to your community. you can stretch the life of every piece of content you produce by looking for ways to combine it with other content types. for example, you might mix and match your content by adding a video to a blog post or using a new e-book in a webinar presentation. it’s always best not to make claims unless you can back them up with data. for example, i can't just sayemail marketingis the best distribution channel without also including a statistic like, ""email marketing produces a high return on investment with a$38 return on every dollar spent.""look for any claims you make in your writing, and find data to support them. dig deep down the research rabbit hole to ensure it's an accurate, legit statistic and not a regurgitated hoax without any original research. ideally, before you create it, connect every piece of content to a specific business goal. will this content drive traffic or help build leads? do we want this content to build brand awareness or drive sales?if you can't find a business goal to support your desired content, put it in the backlog. you might find a purpose for that content idea later, but stick with content creation that supports your immediate kpis and metrics. ai writers and graphic generators are emerging. these tools can help create original content, build outlines, answer questions, and write articles. however, these are still in the infancy stage, and you should avoid over-relying on them.don't be afraid to use ai—just don't abuse it. let it inspire and give you ideas, but don't think it can replace your content marketing team. it can't.need ideas for using ai? try theseai-based email marketing use cases. it's easy for your content marketing team to become a silo. with so much going on and never-ending demand for content, collaboration often gets pushed aside.think of teams you could partner with to bolster your effective content marketing efforts. for example, you might work with product marketing or sales to identify content to support their needs or get help from your developers to write more technical-focused content. old content can start to pile up. while often a vanity metric, lots of underperforming, outdated content just takes up space and accumulates cobwebs.if you can’t revive, optimize, or repurpose a piece, it's time to get rid of it.it'll be hard. you might tear up a bit, and that's ok. if you can't do it yourself, work with a partner who can identify content pieces that need to go objectively.you can do this. we believe in you. the80/20 content rulesuggests you spend: when you publish new content, give it the promotional love it deserves. just because you post something doesn't mean your audience will read or watch it—they likely won't know it exists.use the following promotional channels to distribute every piece of content you produce better: around 1.3 billion people live with some visual impairment—that could be a massive part of your audience. and even if it's not, creating accessible content is just the right thing to do.think aboutaccessibility design best practices, and ensure you add the small touches that make your content widely consumable. for example, add descriptive alt text to your images, and consider providing american sign language (asl) interpretation online whenhosting virtual events. ""hey alexa, how do i optimize my content for voice search?"" voice search isn't just coming...it's already here, and it's changing how people find your content. with smart speakers in millions of homes and voice assistants built into virtually every smartphone, optimizing for voice search isn't negotiable anymore. voice searches are fundamentally different from typed queries. they're conversational, question-based, and typically longer. when someone types, they might search ""best email marketing platform."" but when they speak, it becomes ""what's the best email marketing platform for small businesses?"" here's how to make your content voice-search friendly: gone are the days when content was just a one-way street. static content? boring. today's audience doesn't want to just read your stuff. they want to play with it, manipulate it, and make it their own. interactive content flat-out performs better. quizzes, calculators, polls, and interactive infographics don't just capture attention; they hold it hostage (in the best possible way, of course). think about it:which would you rather consume: a 2,000-word article about email deliverability rates or an interactive tool that analyzes your specific sending patterns and gives you personalized recommendations? create calulators, add quizzes, ask for feedback, enable comments, incorporate sliders and toggles. this is where you go all in on whozits, whatzsits, and thingamabobs. your blog has some deadweight. it doesn't take an seo expert or outside consultant to see that. don't panic, though. you're not alone. we all get to that point sometimes, and it's okay. well, as long as you do something about it, that is. for example, we've deleted, archived, and redirected hundreds of blog posts over the last year or so (and we plan to do a lot more). yes, the vanity metric of number of posts surely takes a hit, but you know what doesn't? our traffic. now, you know those posts: the ones gathering digital dust in the corners of your site, bringing down your averages, and making google question your content quality. it's time for some tough love. by removing underperforming content, you're actually helping your best stuff rank higher. think of it like thinning out seedlings to let the strongest plants thrive. the 80/20 rule applies perfectly here: roughly 20% of your content likely drives 80% of your traffic. the rest? it's just taking up space and diluting your site's authority. ouch, but true. we get it. getting over your emotional attachment to content you worked hard to create. that post from 2019 about email trends might have been your baby, but if it's getting two visits a month and contains outdated advice, it's time to let it go. your content strategy has a serious middle-child syndrome. let me guess: tons of top-of-funnel awareness pieces, a decent chunk of bottom-funnel conversion content, but that middle section? crickets. you're not alone. most content marketers are addicted to vanity metrics like page views (hello, top-of-funnel) or obsessed with conversion rates (bottom-funnel), leaving the critical consideration stage abandoned like a shopping cart on a discount website. your audience isn't ready to buy after reading one ""what is"" blog post, and that case study isn't going to magically appear in front of someone who doesn't know they have a problem. the content journey is real, folks. your funnel needs content at every stage: unfortunately, here's where most companies mess up: they create these pieces in isolation, with no clear path from one stage to the next. you need deliberate content pathways that guide readers logically through the buyer's journey. think of it like a netflix series—each episode should leave viewers wanting the next one. your awareness piece should naturally lead to consideration content, which should make the case for conversion content. you're either using ai tools for content creation or you're falling behind. there's no middle ground anymore. the initial response to ai was predictable: ""but it can't match human creativity!"" true...and also completely missing the point. ai isn't meant to replace your creative process—it's meant to accelerate it, handle the grunt work, and let your team focus on what humans do best: strategic thinking and emotional connection. the key is finding the right human-ai balance. the best content teams use ai as a superpower, not a replacement. they feed the ai their brand voice guidelines, provide specific prompts with context, and then edit the output with their human expertise. the quality gap between ai early adopters and laggards is widening faster than most marketing leaders realize. yes, there are ethical considerations. yes, you should disclose ai usage when appropriate. and yes, you should have clear guidelines about fact-checking and quality control. but sitting on the sidelines isn't an option anymore. remember when your content operation was just you and a wordpress login? those were simpler times. now you've likely got freelancers, agencies, subject matter experts, and that intern who keeps publishing things without approval. content chaos isn't just annoying—it's expensive. without proper governance, you're practically begging for inconsistent messaging, compliance nightmares, and the inevitable ""who approved that?"" moment during the executive review. think of content governance as the guardrails that keep your content machine from driving off a cliff. it's not about bureaucracy. it's about creating systems that scale without sacrificing quality. here's what a solid content governance framework looks like: not everyone has time for your 3,000-word epic guides. there, i said it. speaking of which, this post is getting kind of long, isn't it? huh. we're living in the tiktok era, where attention spans are measured in seconds, not minutes. and while there's absolutely still a place for comprehensive content, ignoring micro-content is like ignoring that half your audience is scrolling on their phones during meetings. micro-content isn't just ""short content""—it's strategically bite-sized pieces designed for immediate consumption and high shareability. think of it as content snacking between the full meals of your longer pieces. it fits perfectly into the gaps of your audience's day—the elevator ride, the coffee line, the three minutes before a meeting starts. when someone doesn't have time for your 45-minute webinar, they might still have time for your 60-second tip video. plus, micro-content is content marketing on easy mode. that statistic that took you hours to research? turn it into a shareable graphic. that key insight buried on page 12 of your whitepaper? make it a standalone social post. your customers are creating content about your brand whether you like it or not. the question is: are you going to leverage it or ignore it? user-generated content isn't just free material—it's authentic social proof that outperforms your polished marketing copy every single time. whennielsen reports that 92% of consumers trust peer recommendationsover advertising, they're basically telling you to stop talking and let your customers do it for you. the smartest brands don't just collect ugc: they actively shape it by providing creative frameworks. starbucks' white cup contest didn't just ask for random photos. it gave clear parameters that resulted in on-brand artistic expressions. ugc creates a virtuous cycle. when customers see you featuring their peers, they're more likely to contribute their own content, creating a sustainable ecosystem of authentic marketing material. that ""universally appealing"" content you're so proud of? it's probably alienating half your global audience. true content localization goes way beyond running your blog posts through google translate and calling it a day. it's about recognizing that different markets have fundamentally different needs, references, pain points, and cultural contexts. when your american case study references baseball metaphors and super bowl ads, you're losing your international audience faster than you can say ""cultural imperialism,"" (and that's a mouthful already). localization isn't just for enterprise companies. even if you're a small business, your digital content reaches global audiences. google analytics probably shows international traffic you're not effectively serving. start small if needed. identify your top international markets and localize your highest-performing content first. then expand as you see results. just please, for the love of global commerce, stop assuming everyone gets your references to ""american as apple pie"" or understands your payment processor that only works with us banks. by the time a keyword shows decent volume in ahrefs or semrush, you're already too late to the party. the competition has arrived, the difficulty has spiked, and you're fighting an uphill battle for rankings. elite content marketers don't chase keywords—they predict them. they identify emerging topics before they hit the research tools and establish authority while everyone else is still wondering if there's an opportunity. the content teams that master this approach buildmassiveauthority while competitors are still waiting for ""sufficient search volume"" to justify creating content. by the time everyone else jumps on the trend, you're already ranking #1 with established backlinks and engagement signals. take ""conversational commerce"" as an example. brands that created definitive content when it was just a concept mentioned at tech conferences dominated the serp by the time it became a high-volume search term. this approach requires confidence and strategic risk-taking. you'll occasionally invest in topics that never take off. but when you're right (which you will be if you're truly connected to your industry), the payoff is fantastic. we've covered a lot, so we decided to help you out by condensing everything into a quick checklist.access the content marketing best practices checklist(no download or email address necessary). whether email is your content creation or distribution channel (or both), twilio sendgrid has all the tools you need for world-class content marketing. get started now.sign up for a free accountto explore everything sendgrid has to offer your content marketing program. from apis to sdks to sample apps api reference documentation, sdks, helper libraries, quickstarts, and tutorials for your language and platform. the latest ebooks, industry reports, and webinars learn from customer engagement experts to improve your own communication. twilio's developer community hub best practices, code samples, and inspiration to build communications and digital engagement experiences.",4242
https://www.akkio.com/beginners-guide-to-machine-learning,The Complete Beginner's Guide to Machine Learning,"machine learning is a branch of computer science that allows computers to automatically infer patterns from data without being explicitly told what these patterns are. these inferences are often based on using algorithms to automatically examine the statistical properties of the data and creating mathematical models to represent the relationship between different quantities. let's contrast this with traditional computing, which relies ondeterministicsystems, wherein we explicitly tell the computer a set of rules to perform a specific task. this method of programming computers is referred to as being rules-based. where machine learning differs from and supersedes, rules-based programming is that it's capable of inferring these rules on its own. say you're a bank manager, and you'd like to figure out whether a loan applicant is likely to default on their loan. in a rules-based approach, the bank manager (or other experts) would explicitly tell the computer that if the applicant's credit score is less than a threshold, reject the application. a machine learning algorithm, however, would simply take in historical data on the credit scores of customers and their loan outcomes and figure out,on its own, what this threshold should be. in doing so, the machine islearning from historical dataandcreating its own rules. this is just an introduction to machine learning, of course, as real-world machine learning models are generally far more complex than a simple threshold. still, it's a great example of just how powerful machine learning can be. any organizational kpi can be optimized as long as you have the relevant data. given a historical customer dataset, for example, you could predict which of your current customers are in danger of leaving, so you can stop churn before it happens. modern approaches to machine learning have made great strides and can accomplish a lot more than just that. from self-driving cars to voice recognition to the automated email filtering systems that flag the spam in your inbox, machine learning algorithms form the basis of many of the advances in technology that we've come to depend on today. next, let's consider the different types of machine learning algorithms and the specific types of problems they can solve. machine learning algorithms are often divided into three general categories (though other classification schemes are also used): supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. supervised machine learning refers to classes of algorithms where the machine learning model is given a set of data with explicit labels for the quantity we're interested in (this quantity is often referred to as the response or target). semi-supervised learning uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to train ai models. if youâre dealing with unlabeled data, youâll need to do data labeling. labeling is the process of annotating examples to help the training of a machine learning model. labeling is typically performed by humans, which can be expensive and time-consuming. however, there are ways to automate the labeling process. a great example of supervised learning is the loan applications scenario we considered earlier. here, we had historical data about past loan applicants' credit scores (and potentially income levels, age, etc.) alongside explicit labels which told us if the person in question defaulted on their loan or not. supervised learning algorithms can be further subdivided intoregressionandclassification. this difference refers to the type of quantity our target is. if the target is a choice between a few discrete categories â for example, will the applicant default or not, is this a picture of a cat, a dog, or a human, etc. â then the problem is referred to asclassification, as we're trying to determine theclassthat a given data point belongs to. if, however, our target variable is continuous, then the problem is referred to asregression. for example, predicting the price of a house given the number of bedrooms and its location. in unsupervised learning problems, the data we're given has no labels, and we're simply looking for patterns. for example, say you're amazon. given customers' purchase history, can we identify any clusters (groups of similar customers)? in this scenario, even though we don't have explicit, definitive data on what a person's interests are, just identifying that a particular group of customers purchase similar items can allow us to make purchase recommendations based on what other people in the cluster have also purchased. similar systems are what power amazon's ""you might also be interested in"" carousel. k-means clustering is a type of clustering model that takes the different groups of customers and assigns them to various clusters, or groups, based on similarities in their behavior patterns. on a technical level, it works by finding the centroid for each cluster, which is then used as the initial mean for the cluster. new customers are then assigned to clusters based on their similarity to other members of that cluster. additionally, once we've identified the clusters, we could then study their characteristics. for example, suppose we see that a given cluster is buying many video games. in that case, we can make an educated guess that this group of customers are gamers, even though no one actually told us so. once we've done this form of analysis, we could potentially even use the labels from unsupervised learning to create supervised learning models that may, for example, allow us to predict how much money a 25-year-old gamer is likely to spend with us compared to a 50-year-old fishing enthusiast. reinforcement learning is a class of machine learning algorithms where we assign a computer agent to perform some task without giving it much guidance on precisely what to do. instead, the computer is allowed to make its own choices and, depending on whether those choices lead to the outcome we want or not, we assign penalties and rewards. we repeat this process multiple times, allowing the computer to learn the optimal way of doing something by trial and error and repeated iterations. think of this as the carrot-and-stick approach to machine learning. it's almost like the computer is playing a video game and discovering what works and what doesn't. interestingly, playing games is precisely the application where reinforcement learning has shown the most astonishing results. google's infamous alphago model, which trounced even the highest-ranked human players of go, was built using reinforcement learning. google has since extended the same technology to alphazero, a successor to the original alphago used as a reference by chess players to determine the best strategies. if you've seen machine learning in the news, you almost certainly have also heard about deep learning. and you might be wondering at this point where deep learning fits into the above paradigm. and the answer is all of them. deep learning is a subset of machine learning that breaks a problem down into several 'layers' of 'neurons.' these neurons arevery looselymodeled on how neurons in the human brain work. this class of machine learning is referred to asdeeplearning because the typical artificial neural network (the collection of all the layers of neurons) often contains many layers. while deep learning was initially used for supervised learning problems, recent advances have extended its capabilities to unsupervised and reinforcement learning problems. and they have shown tremendous results. many of the latest advances in computer vision, which self-driving cars and facial recognition systems depend on, are rooted in the use of deep learning models. natural language processing, which allows computers to understand natural human conversations and powers siri and google assistant, also owes its success to deep learning. today's ai boom is largely thanks to the pioneers of deep learning: geoffrey hinton, yann lecun, and yoshua bengio. these ai engineers were awarded the turing award for their breakthrough advancements in deep neural networks. if you've ever looked at a tech company's website or watched the keynote for apple's latest iphones, you might have seen . since probability is a continuous variable, it naturally extends itself to regression. however, itâs a continuous variable capped by two constraints: a probability can neither be negative nor greater than 1. regular linear regression is incapable of abiding by these constraints, and thus thelogistic modelwas born. logistic regression is an extension of linear regression, which straddles the line between regression and classification. it works on the same principle as linear regression but with a key difference: the response is thenatural log of the odds of an event occurring.â odds, in statistics, refers to the ratio of the probability of an event occurring to the probability of it not occurring: for example, say the probability of barcelona winning their next match is 30%. then, theodds fortheir victory are 3/7 or 3:7. this is also the nomenclature used in gambling, though gambling sites often showodds againstan event and not odds for. theodds againstbarcelona, in this case, would be 7:3. statistically, the most salient aspect of using the natural log of odds is that while the output of the regression model is still unconstrained, when we convert the log odds back to probabilities, these are capped to between 0 and 1, thus solving our problem! while we wonât go into the mathematical details of why that is the case, you can see below a graph of the output probabilitypas the value of the independent variable changes: thus, weâve successfully extended the linear regression model to predict probabilities. once we have an estimate for the probability of an event occurring,classificationis just one step away. if we set a certain probability as athreshold, we can classify each data point (e.g., each customer) into one of two classes. choosing this threshold is largely dependent on the application.â for example, a luxury carmaker that operates on high margins and low volumes may want to be highly proactive and personally check in with customers with even a 20% probability of churn. if churn is not mission-critical or we simply donât have the resources to handle individual customers, we may want to set this threshold much higher (e.g., 90%) so we are alerted to only the most urgent prospects. in the previous section, we dealt with examples ofregression problems, where we want to predict a continuous variable. the second major type ofsupervised learningproblem is classification, where we want to assign each sample into one oftwo (or more) categories. for example, a bank may want to determine if a loan applicant will repay their loan or not. or an email provider might want to build a system that filters out spam from your inbox.â in both these cases, we have only two possible classes/categories, but itâs also possible to handle problems with multiple options. for example, a lead-scoring system might want to distinguish between hot, neutral, and cold leads. computer vision problems are often alsomulti-class problems, as we wish to identify multiple types of objects (cars, people, traffic signs, etc.). in this article, weâll examine some of the algorithms used for classification problems. however, the focus here will be on building intuition, and so we wonât be covering the math behind these algorithms in any detail. weâll also focus on only binary classification problems (i.e., those with only two options) for simplicity. one of the simplest classification algorithms isknn classification. say we have historical data with labels and a new point whose label we want to determine. in this method, we simply find thekpoints closest to the new point and assign its label to be themode(the most commonly occurring class) of thesekpoints. for example, consider the image below. ifk=3, then the label of the green point is a red triangle because, among the three points closest to it, the majority (â ) are red triangles. as we discussed in theregression section, the knn algorithm can also solve nonlinear regression problems. another commonly used classification algorithm is svm. consider the following example where we want to filter out spam emails. the x-axis is the number of times the word âbuyâ appears in the email, and the y-axis is the number of other people who have received the same email. when plotted, the data looks like this: the blue points are legitimate emails, and the red points are spam. spam emails presumably want you to buy things and are sent to more people, so it makes sense that emails sent out to a large number of people with many mentions of the word âbuyâ are spam. more importantly, we see that we can clearly separate the two classes using a straight line, but as with linear regression, this raises the question: which line is the best? as shown below, we can draw many possible lines, all of which perfectly separate between the two classes. we may want to, thus, think about defining what makes one line better than another. this is somewhat dependent on the problem weâre trying to solve, and weâll revisit this point later on.for now, though, a reasonable criterion may be to choose the line which maximizes themarginbetween the two classes â that is, the line which is as far away as possible from the most extreme examples of either class.â this raises another question: how can we translate this into a mathematical problem instead of just doing it by eye? consider the following diagram: we can find the âbestâ line by first drawing two lines that only touch the outermost points of each class. note also that both of these lines are parallel to each other. these lines are calledsupport vectors; hence the name of the algorithm. the âbestâ line is then a line that is parallel to both of these lines and also equidistant from them (i.e., itâs the same distance from each). the distance between the support vectors and the classifier line is called themargin, and we want to maximize this. this is the most common (or default) way in which svm selects the best classifier line. this may not always be the ideal way of doing things, however. for example, say we were working on determining if a tumor is benign or malignant. in this case, the cost of making a mistake is not the same for each class. if we classify a malignant tumor as benign, it could potentially cost the patient their life, while mistaking a benign tumor as malignant might only require further testing. clearly, one mistake is worse than the other. depending on the application and how careful we want to be, we may choose to assign a greater weight to either type of mistake. as such, we may decide to move the line further away from one class or even deliberately mislabel some of the data points simply because we want to be extremely cautious about making a mistake. next, letâs consider scenarios where the two classes cannot be cleanly separated via a straight line. sometimes, it may not be possible to perfectly classify points using a straight line. we could, then, resort to nonlinear methods (discussed later), but for now, letâs stick to only straight lines. in that case, we may be willing to take an imperfect classifier. this is also called asoft classifier, as it does not classify all points correctly. on the other hand, a hard classifier would refer to the examples weâve discussed thus far, which perfectly classify all data points. consider the following example: in the above image, we see that the soft classifier weâve selected misclassifies three points (highlighted in yellow). at the same time, we also see two blue points and two red points (circled in blue) that are extremely close to the line and are near-mistakes. thus, our classifier has a very small margin between the two classes. consider a second possible classifier we could draw for the same data: in this case, we have five misclassified points (compared to three before), but the line has a wider margin and very few points that are near-misses or extremely close to the line. this demonstrates an inherent tradeoff with soft classifiers. we can choose to either minimize errors or maximize the margin between the two classes.â while we wonât show the mathematical details here, we can assign different weights to either of these options depending on how important higher accuracy is compared to having a cleaner, less ambiguous boundary.â this is an example of amodel hyperparameter: a variable that we specify for the algorithm and which defines or in some way constrains the form that our model will take. now, consider the following example: in this case, we see that while a straight line cannot separate these points, a circle can. how can we solve this problem? as weâve seen above, one option may be to use nonlinear methods like knn classification or classification trees.â since these arenonparametric methodsand donât specify a particular form for the model (e.g., that it needs to be a straight line), they are particularly well-suited for nonlinear problems. however, svm can also be extended to solving this problem bytransforming the datato achieve linear separation between the classes. for example, we can see that all the points within a circle of radius 2 are red and those outside it are blue. in a simple case like this, if we convert the data from cartesian to polar coordinates. the resulting plot is shown below, where the x-axis is the radial distance from the origin, and the y-axis is the angle in radians: as can be seen, the classes are now easily separated using a straight line. thus, we would simply feed the svm algorithm this transformed version of the data. in more complex scenarios, especially when we have multi-dimensional problems and donât know that the ideal classifier is, for example, a circle, we may not know which transformation to use. in other cases, the transformation may be computationally inefficient. in these cases, we can transform the problem by adding more dimensions to it. this is referred to as thekernel trickorkernel svmand allows us to create nonlinear classification boundaries like the one below: an explanation of the mechanics or the math of how and why kernel svm works is beyond the scope of this article. still, itâs an important detail to know in order for you to have a comprehensive understanding of the kinds of problems the svm algorithm can solve. kernel methods should be used with svm with caution, however. by adding more dimensions to the problem and allowing for nonlinear boundaries, we are creating a moreflexible model. this can easily lead tooverfitting. another means of solving classification problems â and one thatâs exceptionally well-suited to nonlinear problems â is the use of adecision tree.â since decision trees can be used for both classification and regression problems (see the regression section), the algorithm is sometimes referred to ascart (classification and regression trees). in this method, we divide the data into smaller and smaller subsets based on a series of binary (yes/no) questions. consider the following decision tree for deciding if we should play football or not, based on how the weather affected past games: the balls at the leaf nodes indicate whether we were able to successfully finish a game (blue) with the given weather conditions or whether the game had to be interrupted due to poor weather (red). we see that on most rainy days with wind, we were forced to cancel our games. as such, themodeof this leaf node is red, and we would classify any future rainy and windy days as red (i.e., we probably shouldnât play on those days). note that decision trees are also an excellent example of how machine learning methods differ from more traditional forms of ai. you might recall that in thewhat is the difference between machine learning and aisection, we discussed something calledexpert systems, which are a hierarchy of if/else rules that allow a computer to make a decision. a decision tree is also a hierarchy of binary rules, but the key difference between the two is that the rules in an expert system are defined by a human expert. on the other hand, decision trees figure out what the splitting criteria at stage (i.e., the rules) should be by themselves â which is why we say that the machine islearning. how does it do that? you might have noticed that each of the leaf nodes consists mostly of one class â for example, the sunny + normal humidity node is mostly blue, while the rainy + windy node is mostly red.â thatâs by design. at each stage of building the decision tree, the computer will look at all of the possible options it has and choose the splitting criterion that minimizes the impurity of the subsequent nodes â that is, it tries to ensure that each of the nodes has points belonging to only one class, if possible. of course, if we allow the computer to keep splitting the data into smaller and smaller subsets (i.e., a deep tree), we might eventually end up with a scenario where each leaf node only contains one (or very few) data points. this might lead tooverfitting. therefore themaximum allowable depthis one of the most important hyperparameters when using tree-based methods. deep learning is another excellent example of a classification method. in fact, deep learning models are great at solving problems with multiple classes. theyâre also particularly effective at dealing with nonlinear relationships and unstructured problems as theyâre able to tease out the more abstract interactions between different s they need to offer their patients. healthcare has been rapidly changing over the last few years, with an increased focus on providing holistic care and individualized treatment plans. further, forecasting can help hospitals anticipate patient needs and provide the right services to meet expectations. ultimately, machine learning algorithms make it easy for hospitals to predict the next step in their operations and make more informed decisions about future staffing needs. the result is healthier, happier patients and a stronger bottom line for hospitals. sepsis is a life-threatening condition that can develop suddenly and with devastating consequences. it is a leading cause of death in intensive care units and in hospital settings, and the incidence of sepsis ison the rise. doctors and nurses are constantly challenged by the need to quickly assess patient risk for developing sepsis, which can be difficult when symptoms are non-specific. decades ago, sepsis wasnât much of a concern. today, sepsis accounts for almosta fifthof human deaths. ai complements medical professionals' expertise by providing data-driven insights to identify patients at high risk for developing sepsis. medical professionals can leverage the power of machine learning to aggregate patient data and generate automated alerts tailored to each patient's unique needs. machine learning models are designed to learn from historical data, which can include past sepsis cases, to provide accurate predictions, enabling healthcare professionals to confidently identify patients at high risk for developing sepsis. the average cost of a hospital readmission ranges from$15,000 to $25,000, which leads to wasted resources, unnecessary tests, potentially harmful treatments, delayed patient care, and other damaging consequences. machine learning can help in reducing readmission risk via predictive analytics models that identify at-risk patients. by feeding in historical hospital discharge data, demographics, diagnosis codes, and other factors, medical professionals can calculate the probability that the patient will have a readmission. ai makes it easy for hospitals to identify which patients are most at-risk for readmissions. no-code ai tools donât require any it work or coding, so hospitals can save money and improve the quality of care they provide. ultimately, ai's hospital readmission risk use-case can help hospitals reduce their costs and increase the quality of care they are able to provide to their patients. terrorism is a top concern for intelligence and law enforcement agencies around the world. after 9/11, preventing terrorist attacks became a heavily-funded, prime directive for a number of government agencies. as described in a united nations office of counter-terrorismreport on ai, government agencies can use predictive modeling to identify red flags of radicalization, detect the spread of terrorist misinformation, and counter terrorist narratives. machine learning isn't just for marketing; it can also be used to help prevent terror attacks by identifying patterns in past events and predicting future ones, saving lives, and making the world a safer place. fraud is an issue that is costly, not only to the government and its citizens, but to companies as well. every government agency from the irs to the social security administration suffers significant losses from fraud.â in fact, as explored in an association of certified fraud examinersreport, a study of nearly 3,000 cases of occupational fraud found that government entities ""were the most represented sectors among the fraud cases analyzed."" while much public discourse centers around governments as perpetrators of fraud, the reality is often that government employees and agencies are often the targets of a wide-range of fraudulent activities. fraudulent activities can be difficult to detect, costing agencies valuable time and resources. ultimately, ai makes it easy for government agencies to detect fraudulent activities as they happen, saving them time and resources while also safeguarding taxpayer dollars. in the age of digital transformation, attack vectors are getting ever larger. as a result, even government agencies are at risk of being breached by insiders (or ex-employees) who want to use their data for malicious purposes. at the same time, there are a number of insider threats that can seem innocuous in nature, but costly nonetheless, such as sending company information over a personal account, or even accidentally misconfiguring access credentials. for example, while cybersecurity firms like to keep their exact techniques private,research showsthat ai can accurately identify malicious emails, which cost governments billions of dollars if undetected. to make sure that firms donât have to pay for these kinds of internal breaches, agencies need to proactively block any potential misuse, using machine learning to identify risks.â cyberattacks are on the rise, with real-world consequences for everyday people. recently, for instance,hackersstopped gasoline and jet fuel pipelines and closed off beef and pork production at a leading us supplier. these are just a couple of examples of the tens of thousands of annual cybersecurity attacks. one of the main challenges in cybersecurity today is an ever-growing attack vector. as more and more of our world goes digital, thereâs more data to keep track of, and itâs easier for hackers to go unnoticed. manually combing through this data can only get you so far, but ai can scan massive amounts of data in real-time. no-code ai enables security teams to build, deploy and refresh models to predict incoming threats in real-time, whether itâs scanning incoming emails for malicious threats or flagging concerning ip activity, so they can prevent a breach before it happens. ultimately, this enables security teams to reduce their risk exposure and prepare for an increasingly hostile cyber landscape. teams that fail to deploy ai for cybersecurity will be more vulnerable to attacks compared to other market players who do. good customer service is of universal importance, with surveys indicating that96%of customers feel customer service is important in their choice of loyalty to a brand. customer service is also a major factor in customer retention. in other words, people are more likely to stay with a company if they're satisfied with the service they receive. ai-based classification of customer support tickets can help companies respond to queries in an efficient manner. by combining natural language processing and machine learning, ai can be used to automatically group queries into predefined categories, making it easy for customer support teams to select the appropriate department to handle a query based on their area of expertise. essentially, by digesting past queries to find patterns in strategy. customer support teams need to handle a huge number of customer queries in a limited time, and they're often not sure which tickets need to be addressed first. machine learning models can rank tickets according to their urgency, with the most urgent tickets addressed first. this relieves teams of the burden of deciding which tickets require the most attention, freeing up more time for actually addressing tickets and satisfying customers. predictive analytics is also useful for identifying patterns in the data so that customer queries can be more accurately met with answers, and it allows teams to improve their customer experience by responding faster. social media is an invaluable tool for marketing and customer support teams, but it's a complicated and fast-moving landscape. every day, millions of people post their thoughts, opinions, and suggestions to social media about brands they're interacting with. from a raving comment to a scathing review, social media posts can have a big impact on your company's success.â machine learning can help teams make sense of the vast amount of social media data, by automatically classifying the sentiment of posts in real-time thanks to models trained on historical data. this enables teams to respond faster and more effectively to customer feedback. ultimately, this allows marketers and customer service teams to identify early warning signs of dissatisfaction before they spiral out of control and needlessly drive away customers. in the process of data entry, we know that errors will be made. humans are not perfect and this includes those who code the data: editing mistakes can occur such as inverting an âsâ or a âzâ in the input document. it is reasonable to assume that there may be multiple copies of your records in which different people may have typed one letter wrong or did not notice inconsistent formatting, such as âsmithâ versus âsmith,â before saving it as a new version. additionally, data can be brought in by multiple systems, with different column values, such that duplicates wonât be found by traditional means (e.g. one system has the first and last name, while another system has their email). detecting duplicates is notoriously difficult, requiring manual intervention to identify duplicate records. this can be time-consuming and prone to human error. ai is different: it's fully automated and can detect duplicates for all types of fields with high accuracy. ai is essential for complex deduplication tasks, because the same record could show up multiple times throughout your database. with ai, you can detect these duplicates even if they have different data fields - making it easy to clean up your database so that it adheres to best practices without any manual intervention. lead scoring is a powerful way to determine which leads are most in need of your attention. ai enables teams to automatically predict the likelihood that each lead will become a paying customer. armed with these insights, marketing teams can decide which leads to pursue and spend time on, and which to put on the back-burner. todayâs lead scoring is powered by machine learning that leverages any historical data, whether from salesforce, snowflake, google sheets, or any other source, to predict the likelihood a given lead will convert.â this insight helps marketing teams to identify leads that are in need of more attention, as well as those that are likely to be a waste of time for the team. as a business, forecasting is one of your most important tasks. it's what allows you to plan ahead and make better use of your budget. machine learning can help you do that with unparalleled accuracy, even in unpredictable economic environments. no-code ai can be used to quickly build a model from past sales data and predict the sales you're likely to receive in the future. with no-code ai, you can get accurate forecasts in a matter of seconds by uploading your product catalog and past sales data. instead of relying on rules of thumb or gut feelings, ai offers a more scientific approach that lets you make better decisions about your budget, staff hiring, and promotional campaigns. this is essential for businesses that need to know how to budget for the future or optimize their limited resources. forecasting models can be deployed through a web-based interface, api, salesforce, or even through zapier, making it easy to get started in any setting without requiring any data science know-how. the way we consume goods has changed. in the past, we would go to the store, pick out what we needed, and purchase it. nowadays, we can order what we need from the comfort of our own home and have it delivered to our door. as a result, the way we are marketed to has changed. direct marketing is an excellent way for businesses to reach their potential customers, and itâs a largely under-utilized opportunity. that said, it's often difficult to determine which prospects are the most likely to purchase. marketing to uninterested leads isnât just a waste of time and money - it can be a huge turn-off to those leads from ever deciding to make a purchase decision. that's where data-driven ai comes in. ai can find the best prospects among a particular group and determine the best way to reach them. this means you can quickly and easily identify the most valuable leads, and then contact them with a personalized message that speaks to their particular needs. with no-code ai, you can effortlessly prioritize and classify leads based on their likelihood of converting, all at a fraction of the time and cost that traditional methods require. a loyalty program is a reward program that gives points or other awards to customers who shop at a particular establishment. a typical example might be a program that provides each customer with ten points for every dollar spent at the store, and if a customer collects 1,000 points, they are given $10 off their purchase. loyalty programs are designed to incentivize customers to shop with the company on a regular basis, and they usually consist of various tiers of rewards, depending on how much the customer spends each time. the most effective type of loyalty program is one that provides increased benefits based on the amount of money spent, as customers are more likely to be motivated by the prospect of an increased reward.â unfortunately, even if you have a good understanding of your customers' behaviors and preferences, it is not easy to predict which rewards will incentivize them most effectively. while your neighborhood coffee shop might offer a free coffee for every fifth visit, the scale and complexity of loyalty programs are orders of magnitude greater for large, data-driven firms. machine learning algorithms can analyze past data and detect which customer segments are most likely to respond positively to certain rewards. this helps managers make informed decisions about which rewards to offer and when, increasing the likelihood that they will convert. one of the best ways that marketers can create a personalized experience for customers is by considering the ""next best offer."" this requires marketers to take into account all of the possible actions they could take with that customer and then select the most appropriate one. as an example, suppose that a customer visits a website for information on renting. the customer can't decide between a studio or one-bedroom apartment, so she searches for more information on both and cannot find any definitive information. in this case, the ""next best offer"" could be to create a personalized email with links to articles and videos from both types of apartments, so the customer can decide which one is better for her. doing this manually is clearly impossible at scale. businesses can use ai to offer the right product to the right person at the right time.â businesses can automatically make recommendations in real-time, using predictive models that account for customer preferences, price sensitivity, and product availability, or any data provided for training. predicting the right offer for the right person at the right time is a huge undertaking, but ai makes it easy for retailers to optimize their operations. best of all, retailers don't need any data scientists or ai specialists to deploy predictive models - no-code ai automatically powers recommendations with no coding required. if your marketing budget includes advertising on social media, the web, tv, and more, it can be difficult to tell which channels are most responsible for driving sales. with machine learning-driven attribution modeling, teams can quickly and easily identify which marketing activities are driving the most revenue. marketing attribution models are traditionally built through large-scale statistical analysis, which is time-consuming and expensive. no-code ai platforms can build accurate attribution models in just seconds, and non-technical teams can deploy the models in any setting. this lets marketing teams keep costs down while still pinpointing exactly where to allocate their marketing budget to optimize for the best roi. ultimately, this makes it easier to ensure that every dollar spent on marketing is worth it, so you're consistently getting the most out of your marketing budget. by automating attribution, marketers can overcome the boring stuff and get more creative with what really matters. armed with knowledge on how specific channels are performing, marketers can finally double-down on high-performing channels, eliminate the laggards, and strategize how to move forward. consumers today expect personalized products and content.â machine learning enables businesses to finally target consumers with the right message, at the right time, and on the right channel. for example, rather than using one message to reach everyone on your website, machine learning could be used for sentiment analysis of customer reviews on your site, or your crm or social media tools, to present different customer segments with different messages. in addition, ai platforms can be trained on historical product purchase data to build a product recommendations model. for example, if a customer has purchased a certain product in the past, an ai api can be deployed to recommend related products that the customer is likely to be interested in. this can be a powerful propellant for the bottom line, as research shows that80%of consumers are more likely to make a purchase when brands offer personalized experiences. beyond personalized experiences, ai can even be used for personalizing products and services themselves. while today, many of these individualized products are created by an individual designer or a custom order, personalized ai will make this process much more efficient, tailoring the product to an individual customer's needs and delivering it in a matter of days. the churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition, is the number of customers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period. for a company to grow, it must acquire more new customers than its churn rate. it's quite a challenge to prevent customer churn, which is why it's so important for companies to be proactive. fortunately, ai has the power to do just that. machine learning algorithms can identify the data patterns common among customers who are likely to churn, such as those with a high cost of acquisition or those that are misaligned with your ideal customer persona.â armed with this knowledge, you can optimize your retention strategy by targeting high-risk customers with personalized offers or incentives before they leave. moreover, marketing teams can tailor their strategies to avoid high-churn-profile leads. the more data you have, the better. ai platforms like akkio allow you to work with your data sources wherever they are - your crm system, data warehouses, and other databases - to create the best model for predicting churn for your business. when it comes to marketing, there are always more tactics to explore than time or resources allow. trying to decide which channel or activity to focus on that will have the biggest impact on revenue means you're forced to make guesses. ai can put those guesses to the test. machine learning algorithms can be fed with data from all of your marketing channels, as well as customer lifecycle information, to identify which activities are most likely to move each individual customer closer to purchase. a/b testing is a great way to figure out how best to allocate marketing resources, but only if you can measure success accurately. that's where machine learning excels: it's able not only to measure and predict sales, but also predict what might happen if you try any given marketing tactic.â google adwords is a huge part of most advertising budgets, but it can be difficult to get bidding right. if you bid too low, you lose out on opportunities. if you bid too high, your marketing roi will dwindle.â however, machine learning can make this process easier by building a model off of past marketing and sales activities to predict the sales volume attributable to each adword, making it easy to determine the optimal price to bid to achieve your target roi while avoiding losing the word to a competitor. it is incredibly difficult and time-consuming for teams to build auction models that can capture complex human behavior. but no-code ai can be used to build accurate models with just a few clicks. companies can deploy these models easily with an api in any setting or even with no-code tools like zapier.â ultimately, this enables marketing teams to boost the effectiveness of their ad spend, which is critical for success in an ever-more competitive landscape for consumer attention. teams that fail to deploy ai for adwords bidding will lose directly to their competitors that are using data-driven strategies. lead scoring is a crucial part of any marketing campaign because it helps you focus your time and resources on the potential customers that are most likely to become paying customers. in other words, an accurate lead scoring model helps you go where the money is. in fact,over two-thirdsof marketers point to lead scoring as a top revenue contributor. accurate lead scoring can be tough, though. it's not easy to measure how well a customer will interact with your product without knowing much about them, so traditional lead scoring models rely on interest from the prospect to determine the score. traditional approaches are highly limited, since they donât necessarily indicate the prospectâs ability or true probability of making a purchase. that's where ai comes in. machine learning models use a wide range of factors to score marketing leads. with data-driven lead scoring models, you can have more confidence in your marketing decisions because you're looking at more data points than just interest from the prospect. studies have shown that attracting and retaining top talent is one of the most important factors in a company's success. after all, the average employee exit costs an entirethirdof their annual salary. however, as employee-employer relationships are shifting, the challenge of getting and keeping top talent is getting tougher. year after year, employee attrition is increasing, and some are calling this crisis âthe great resignation.â but there's hope: data. no-code ai platforms let hr professionals scan massive amounts of data - from hiring pipelines to employee history or performance reviews - to uncover insights to keep your best people working for your team.â with no-code ai, you can use machine learning algorithms to create predictive models that let you predict when an employee might be considering a job change, when they might be considering leaving their current position, or if they're simply unsatisfied. this data-driven approach illuminates potential issues before they become major problems, giving hr teams the high-quality insights they need for more informed decision-making. with tools like zapier, hr teams can even deploy predictive models in any setting without writing code. for many, machine learning might as well be magic. but the truth is, as weâve seen, that itâs really just advanced statistics, empowered by the growth of data and more powerful computers. having said that, machine learning modelsareincredibly versatile tools that can add tremendous value across business units. we saw earlier, for example, how finance teams can use machine learning topredict fraud, marketing teams canscore leadsorpredict churn, hr teams canpredict attrition, and more. building the machine learning models to make these use-cases possible was once an arduous, resource-intensive task, requiring technical experts for data engineering, building pipelines, coding, maintaining infrastructure, and more. as weâve explored, no-code ai allows anyone to create and deploy machine learning models on their own, without needing programming skills. however, to become truly ai-driven, getting ai to work for you is not a one-time upgrade. it is a journey that will require an understanding of data management and the use of machine learning. another reason that code-based ai is problematic is that there is a shortage of programmers, and the shortfall is expected to grow as the ai industry grows. as acmreports, thereâs actually a recent decrease in computer science graduates, in spite of increasing demand for them, fueled by delays in student visa processing, limited access to educational loans, and travel embargos. as weâve seen, data is the fuel that powers machine learning engines, which is why data preparation is so important when building a model. the expression âthe more the merrier'' holds true in machine learning, which typically performs better with larger, high-quality datasets. with akkio, you can connect this data from a number of sources, such as a csv file, an excel sheet, or from snowflake (a data warehouse) or salesforce (a customer relationship manager). for example, suppose youâd like to use ai toscore sales leads. if your business uses salesforce, you can directly connect your sales dataset, and then select a column that relates to whether or not a deal was closed. many smaller sales teams keep it simple, using google sheets or excel to organize lead data. both of these sources can be easily connected to akkio as well, and youâd build the model in the same wayâby selecting the column youâd like to predict. on the other end of the spectrum, some larger firms use snowflake for handling massive amounts of sales data, which can be easily integrated with akkio as well. weâve explored how machine learning models are mathematical algorithms that are used to find patterns in data. to train a machine learning model, you need a high-quality dataset that is representative of the problem youâre trying to solve. letâs walk through a practical example. in akkio, you can train a model by hitting âadd stepâ once a dataset is connected, and then âpredict.â then, simply select the column to predict.â generally speaking, there are two kinds of models you can train: classification models and regression models.â a few examples of classification include fraud prediction, lead conversion prediction, and churn prediction. the output values of these examples are all âyesâ or âno,â or similar such classes. on the other hand, regression models are used to predict a range of output variables, such as sales revenue or costs. after selecting âpredict,â training either kind of model is the same: youâll select the column name you want to predict, whether itâs called conversion, churn, attrition, fraud, or any other metric. you also have the option to select a âtraining mode,â which ranges from 10 seconds of training time to 5 minutes, where longer training times may lead to more accurate models. while the training process is done in just a couple clicks, a lot of work is done in the background. it starts with software engineering to lay the groundwork for the platform itself. software engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the design, development, operation, and maintenance of software. most of today's software development activities are performed by a team of engineers.â but thatâs not all. devops is used to help bring ai applications to production. devops is a software development method that focuses on the collaboration between software developers and other it professionals. it aims to shorten the time between the software's conception and its adoption by end users. in order to build the ai pattern recognition models themselves, a number of different approaches are used. pattern recognition is the ability to identify a pattern in data and match that pattern in new data. this is a key part of machine learning, and it can be either supervised or unsupervised.â the bayesian approach to ai is a probabilistic approach to making decisions. bayesian methods are used to estimate the probability of a hypothesis, based on prior knowledge and new evidence. another technique is dimensionality reduction, a process that reduces the number of dimensions of a dataset by identifying which are important and removing those that are not. k-means clustering and pca, or principle component analysis, are two methods commonly used together. in order to group associated data points, k-means finds the partition in data, while pca finds the cluster membership vector. random forest is another common method. a random forest is a machine learning method that generates multiple decision trees on the same input features. the hierarchy of decision trees is built by randomly selecting observations to root each tree. gradient descent is a commonly used technique in various model training methods. itâs used to find the local minimum in a function through an iterative process of âdescending the gradientâ of error. these ai methods are often built with tools like tensorflow, onnx, and pytorch. tensorflow is an open-source software library for machine intelligence that provides a set of tools for data scientists and machine learning engineers to build and train neural nets. it is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. onnx is an open-source modeling language for neural networks that was created to make it easier for ai developers to transfer their algorithms between systems and applications. this open-source ai framework was made to be widely available to anyone who wants to use it. pytorch is an open source machine learning library for python, based on torch. pytorch provides gpu acceleration and can be used either as a command line tool or through jupyter notebooks. pytorch has been designed with a python-first approach, allowing researchers to prototype models quickly. all of these model training processes are iterative, and many technical model training considerations are accounted for.â one of these concerns is overfitting, which happens when a model tries to predict every individual input that it might get instead of just being able to predict certain patterns in the data.â there are best practices that can be followed when training machine learning models in order to prevent these mistakes from happening. one of these best practices is regularization, which helps with overfitting by shrinking parameters (e.g., weights) until they make less impact on predictions. an additional best practice for successful training is using cross validation. another concern is called the âcurse of dimensionality.â this happens when the number of inputs to a model gets too large for it to work properly, especially if many inputs are not statistically relevant to the outcome being predicted. a way to get around this is by simplifying or reducing the number of features or dimensions being used in order to make more accurate predictions - this is known as âdimensionality reduction.â one technique for dimensionality reduction is called principal component analysis, or pca. pca turns a large amount of data into a few categories that are most useful for describing the properties of what youâre measuring. not all machine learning models are made equal. thereâs a popular saying in the ai world: âgarbage in, garbage out.â if low-quality data is used to build a machine learning model, then the model will generate low-quality predictions as well. there are a number of metrics you can use to evaluate the performance of a model. after making any model in akkio, you get a model report, including a âprediction qualityâ section. if youâve built a classification model, the quality metrics include percentage accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score, as well as the number of values predicted correctly and incorrectly for each class.â here are what these fields mean: because forecasting is used to predict a range of values, as opposed to a limited set of classes, there are different evaluation metrics to consider. after building a forecasting model, such as for cost modeling, youâll see an rmse value and a field called âusually within.ââ rmse stands for root mean square error, which is the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors). the âusually withinâ field provides values that are simpler to understand in context, such as a cost model thatâs âusually withinâ $40 of the actual value. venturebeatreportsthat 87% machine learning models never make it into production. this is affirmed by a separatestudyindicating that just 14.6% of firms have deployed ai capabilities in production. we canât blame them. ai is a difficult task, and many companies try to reinvent the wheel by building their own data pipelines, model infrastructure, and more. at the same time, a mckinsey survey found that just8%of respondents engaged in effective scaling practices. what this means is that many firms are building models, but are unable to deploy them, particularly at scale. with akkio, businesses can effortlessly deploy models at scale in a range of environments. more technical users can use our api to serve predictions in practically any setting, while business users can deploy predictions directly in salesforce, snowflake, google sheets, and thousands of other apps with the power of zapier. the term api is short for ""application programming interface,"" and it's a way for software to talk to other software. apis are often used in cloud computing and iot applications to connect systems, services, and devices. by querying akkioâs api endpoints, businesses can send data to any model and get a prediction back in the form of a json data structure.â for context, data structures refer to the way data is organized in a computer program. data structures are built on two concepts: data types and data manipulation. data types define the type of data in the structure, such as number, word, or image. data manipulation defines how data is organized in the structure, such as linear, hierarchical, or tree. models can even be deployed via web app to instantly get a url to share with others. when you hit âdeployâ for a web app, youâll also get an iframe embed (an inline frame), which is an html tag that can be embedded in any site.â users who deploy models can take advantage of cloud storage that scales to accommodate unlimited data uploads. ai is the next growth engine for cloud storage, with a massive annual growth rate. further, these cloud servers are home to huge graphical processing unit (gpu) clusters. ai algorithms that require a lot of mathematical calculations, such as neural networks, are well suited to gpu processing, such that cloud servers enable unlimited scalability of model predictions. the importance of continuous learning in machine learning cannot be overstated. continuous learning is the process of improving a system's performance by updating the system as new data becomes available. continuous learning is the key to creating machine learning models that will be used years down the road. the process of updating a system with new data, or âlearningâ, is something that is done by people all the time. continuous learning seeks to replicate this process in a machine. the key to building robust models that continue to be valuable in the future is to learn from new information as it becomes available. this would allow the machine to adjust its behavior accordingly when responding to new information, just like humans do. the more data a machine has, the more effective it will be at responding to new information. the extent to which continuous learning is applied will help determine how intelligent the system is and how well it responds to new situations. machine learning operations (mlops) is the compendium of services and tools that an organization uses to help train and deploy machine learning models.â mlops services help businesses and developers to get started with ai, with service offerings that include data preparation, model training, hyper-parameter tuning, model deployment, and ongoing monitoring and maintenance. organizations with a large training pipeline need mlops to efficiently scale training and production operations. these services allow developers to tap into the power of ai without having to invest as much in the infrastructure and expertise that are required to build ai systems. with akkio, machine learning operations are standardized, streamlined, and automated in the background, allowing non-technical users to have access to the same caliber of features as industry experts. to recap, data preparation is the process of transforming raw data into a format that is appropriate for modeling, which makes it a key component of machine learning operations. this process typically includes splitting the data into parts for training and validation, and normalizing the data. this means randomly splitting the data into a set of two subsets, known as âtraining dataâ and âtesting dataâ (this is called stratified sampling). the first subset is then trained to try and find patterns in the data, but the model doesn't know what's coming next. the second subset is used as new input the ai has never seen before, which helps better predict outcomes. that way, when you create predictions on new inputs using this model, they're more accurate, because you're using examples that have not already been seen by the model.â data preparation can also include normalizing values within one column so that each value falls between 0 and 1 or belongs to a particular range of values (a process known as binning). for example, if someone were providing demographic information about people who visit their website and are able to purchase goods online, it would be helpful to split them into male or female; under 18 or over 18 years old; and so on, in order to classify their behavior while browsing based on these groupings. the training phase is where machine learning models are generated out of algorithms. the algorithm may determine which features of the data are most predictive for the desired outcome. this phase can be divided into several sub-steps, including feature selection, model training, and hyperparameter optimization. the goal of feature selection is to find a subset of features that still captures variability in the data, while excluding those features that are irrelevant or have a weak correlation with the desired outcome. machine learning algorithms are supported by inferential statistics to ""train"" the model, such that it is able to make ""inferences"" about new data.â machine learning will often operate via a feedback loop whereby input data starts with an empty algorithm, which then finds patterns in that data over the course of multiple iterations. that information is fed back into the algorithm which modifies its parameters and goes through another iteration for refinement, until the optimal model is found. finally, hyperparameter optimization determines what set of hyperparameter settings should be used based on some criteria, such as cost or computational efficiency. factors to consider when evaluating model hyperparameter tunings can include:â the process of deploying an ai model is often the most difficult step of mlops, which explains why so many ai models are built, but not deployed.â there are a number of different considerations to plan for, including: how will data be queried? what product or service will the ai model be embedded into? how do we ensure that all pieces of the model will continue to work together as expected over time?â these are just some of many questions which must be addressed before deployment. with akkio, teams can deploy models without having to worry about these considerations, and can select their deployment environment in clicks. nowadays, there are many creative ways to deploy ai. for instance, you can deploy models on mobile phones with limited bandwidth, or even offline-capable ai servers. offline ai is a model deployment option that can be used to serve predictions locally, or âat the edge,â for use-cases like smart cctvs that might be in a wireless dead zone, or even ai-powered medical diagnostic apps that deal with sensitive health data.â building and deploying any type of ai model can seem daunting, but with no-code ai tools like akkio, itâs truly effortless. as long as teams have the data, which can come from tools like salesforce, snowflake, or even just a google sheets file, they can effortlessly train and deploy intelligent models, for everything from churn prediction to sales funnel optimization.",9974

collect the data that might help solve the problem. this could be from databases, logs, sensors, files, or apis. if available, from where i can get this data? how can i get this data? download data or web scrapping? example: from your order cancellation problem, gather- a) customer profiles, b) order history, c) product data, d) time of order, e)delivery location, f) feedback or complaints. note: data can be structured (tables), semi-structured (json), or unstructured (text, images). raw data is messy! this step ensures your data isclean, complete, and usable. data cleaning involves getting rid of inconsistencies in data such as missing values or redundant values. tasks include:- 1)handling missing values, 2)removing duplicates, 3)encoding categorical variables (e.g., “male”, “female” → 0, 1), 4)normalizing or scaling numbers and 5)creating features from raw columns (e.g., extracting day of week from a timestamp). example: if some orders have no delivery location, you can- data exploration involves understanding the patterns and trends in data. at this stage all the useful insight are drawn and correlations between the variables are understood. correlationsimply means: how strongly does one variable move (increase or decrease) when another variable changes? understand your data usingvisuals and statistics. this helps you: it helps us answer questions like: example: 1) use plots like histograms, scatter plots, box plots. 2)correlation heatmaps to see how features relate to the output and 3)you might find that: “most canceled orders happen in remote locations or during holidays” goal: gaininsightsto improve model performance and decide which features matter. at this stage a predictive models is built by using ml algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees etc. choose an ml algorithm, split your data intotraining and testing sets, and use the training data tocreate a model. example: algorithm- logistic regression (for yes/no prediction). in this stage, we split our dataset into two parts- in this customer order example, output is based on categorical variable i.e. either order cancelled or not cancelled. in this case we use- classification algorithm. evaluate how well your model performs on unseen data. the efficiency of the model is evaluated and any further improvements in the model are implemented. key metrics: accuracy, precision & recall (for imbalance), f1 score and auc-roc. the testing dataset is used to check the efficiency of the model and how accurately it can predict the outcome. example: your model has 92% accuracy — sounds good. but precision = 60% and recall = 40%? not good for fraud detection or healthcare. tune it. further improvement in the model are done by using techniques like: cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning (grid search, random search) and feature selection. now your trained model is ready topredict on new, real-world data— make it available as a service or embed it in an app. example: when a new customer places an order, your deployed model predicts- “there is a 72% chance the order will be canceled — flag it for manual review.” you can retrain the model regularly with fresh data — this ismodel lifecycle management. supervised learning is a technique in which we train or teach the machine using data which is well labelled. real-world example:loan approval prediction semi-supervised learning is a branch of machine learning that combines supervised and unsupervised learning by using both labeled and unlabeled data to train artificial intelligence (ai) models. real-world example:medical image classification unsupervised learning is the training of machine using information that is unlabeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without any guidance. real-world example:customer segmentation in e-commerce reinforcement learning is a part of machine learning where an agent is put in an environment and he learns to behave in this environment by performing certain actions and observing the rewards which it gets from those actions. real-world example:self-driving car navigation self-supervised learning (ssl) is a machine learning paradigm where models learn from unlabeled data by automatically generating their own labels or supervisory signals. instead of relying on manually labeled datasets, ssl algorithms define pretext tasks that allow the model to learn meaningful representations of the data by inferring relationships or patterns within the unlabeled input. ✅start with data → define the objective → choose the learning type → select the algorithm → train the model → use it for predictions/decisions. allmachine learningproblemsare grouped intothree major typesbased onwhat kind of question you’re trying to answer— and that defines how the model willlearn and predict. question being asked: “how much?”, “what is the number?” real-world example: predict house prices. question being asked: “which category does it belong to?” real-world example: spam email detection. question being asked: “what are the natural groups or segments?” real-world example: customer segmentation in marketing. machine learning problems are grouped as: all the problems which you gave to your machine learning model will fall into one of these categories. in machine learning, once your data and problem are defined, the next big decision ishow to build the model. there arethree main types of modelsthat you can use — and each is trained using one or more of the five learning types:supervised,unsupervised,semi-supervised,reinforcement, andself-supervised learning. these aremodels that have already been trainedon massive datasets by researchers or companies. they are trained on general tasks (like predicting the next word or filling in blanks) and can be used directly for many common problems. this means you take apre-trained modeland then train itfurtheron your ownlabeled dataset. this process adapts the general intelligence of the model to your specific use case. in some cases, you may want to build a modelentirely from the ground upusing your own algorithms and data. “the ultimate goal of machine learning is not just to create a model — but to solve real-world problems intelligently, efficiently, and at scale.” machine learning can solve a wide range ofcomplex, data-driven problemsthat are hard or impossible to solve using traditional programming: machine learning is transforming every industry —from saving lives to increasing profits— making businesses smarter and society better. everything begins with thedream of building intelligent machines— systems that can see, read, listen, speak, and make decisions like humans. but how do we make machinesintelligent?

https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/deep-learning/,What is Deep Learning? - Deep Learning AI Explained - AWS,"deep learning is anartificial intelligence (ai)methodthat teaches computers to process data in a way inspired by the human brain. deep learning models can recognize complex pictures, text, sounds, and other data patterns to produce accurate insights and predictions. you can use deep learning methods to automate tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as describing images or transcribing a sound file into text. watch our introduction to deep learning deep generative learning is deep learning that focuses on creating new output from learned input. traditionally, deep learning focused on identifying relationships between data. deep learning models were trained with large amounts of data to recognize patterns in the data set. deep generative learning adds generation to pattern recognition. such models look for data patterns and then create their own unique patterns. for example, they can analyze the text in several books and then use the information to generate new sentences and paragraphs not found in the original books. deep generative learning is the basis of moderngenerative aiandfoundation models. these models use deep learning technologies at scale, trained on vast data, to perform complex tasks like answering questions, creating images from text, and writing content. watch an introductory video to foundation models deep learning technology drives many artificial intelligence applications used in everyday products, such as the following: it is also a critical component of technologies like self-driving cars, virtual reality, and more. businesses use deep learning models to analyze data and make predictions in various applications. deep learning has several use cases in automotive, aerospace, manufacturing, electronics, medical research, and other fields. these various use cases of deep learning can be grouped into five broad categories: computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing (nlp), recommendation engines, and generative ai. computer visionautomatically extracts information and insights from images and videos. deep learning techniques to comprehend images in the same way that humans do. computer vision has several applications, such as the following: deep learning models can analyze human speech despite varying speech patterns, pitch, tone, language, and accent. virtual assistants such as amazon alexa,text-to-speech, andspeech-to-text softwareuse speech recognition to do the following tasks: computers use deep learning algorithms to gather insights andmeaning from text dataand documents. this ability to process natural, human-created text has several use cases, including: applications can use deep learning methods to track user activity and developpersonalized recommendations. they can analyze users' behavior and help them discover new products or services. for example, generative ai applications can create new content and communicate with end users more sophisticatedly. they can assist in automating complex workflows, brainstorming ideas, and intelligent knowledge searches. for example, with generative ai tools likeamazon q businessandamazon q developer, users can deep learning models are neural networks designed after the human brain. a human brain contains millions of interconnected biological neurons that work together to learn and process information. similarly, artificial neurons are software modules called nodes that use mathematical calculations to process data. deep learning neural networks, or artificial neural networks, comprise many layers of artificial neurons that work together to solve complex problems. the components of a deep neural network are the following. an artificial neural network has several nodes that input data into it. these nodes make up the system's input layer. the input layer processes and passes the data to layers further in the neural network. these hidden layers process information at different levels, adapting their behavior as they receive new information. deep learning networks have hundreds of hidden layers that they can use to analyze a problem from several different angles. for example, if you were given an image of an unknown animal that you had to classify, you would compare it with animals you already know. for example, you would look at the shape of its eyes and ears, size, number of legs, and fur pattern. you would try to identify patterns, such as the following: the hidden layers in deep neural networks work in the same way. if a deep learning algorithm tries to classify an animal image, each of its hidden layers processes a different animal feature and tries to categorize it accurately. the output layer consists of the nodes that output the data. deep learning models that output ""yes"" or ""no"" answers have only two nodes in the output layer. on the other hand, those that output a wider range of answers have more nodes. generative ai has a sophisticated output layer to generate new data that matches patterns in its training data set. the without requiring infrastructure to host

https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide,SEO Starter Guide: The Basics | Google Search Central  |  Documentation  |  Google for Developers,"when you built your website, you likely created it with your users in mind, trying to make it easy for them to find and explore your content. one of those users is a search engine, which helps people discover your content. seo—short for search engine optimization—is about helping search engines understand your content, and helping users find your site and make a decision about whether they should visit your site through a search engine. thesearch essentialsoutline the most important elements of what makes your website eligible to appear on google search. while there's no guarantee that any particular site will be added to google's index, sites that follow thesearch essentials are more likely to show up in google's search results. seo is about taking the next step andworking on improving your site's presence in search. this guide will walk you through some of the most common and effective improvements you can do on your site. there are no secrets here that'll automatically rank your site first in google (sorry!). in fact some of the suggestions might not even apply to your business, but following the best practices will hopefully make it easier for search engines (not just google) to crawl, index, and understand your content. google is a fully automated search engine that uses programs called crawlers to explore the web constantly, looking for pages to add to our index. you usually don't need to do anything except publish your site on the web. in fact, the vast majority of sites listed in our results are found and added automatically as we crawl the web. if you're hungry for more, we have documentation about howgoogle discovers, crawls, and serves web pages. every change you make will take some time to be reflected on google's end. some changes might take effect in a few hours, others could take several months. in general, you likely want to wait a few weeks to assess whether your work had beneficial effects in google search results. keep in mind that not all changes you make to your website will result in noticeable impact in search results; if you're not satisfied with your results and your business strategies allow it, try iterating with the changes and see if they make a difference. before you actually do anything mentioned in this section, check if google has already found your content (maybe you don't need to do anything!). try searching on google for your site with thesite: search operator. if you see results pointing to your site, you're in the index. for example, a search forsite:wikipedia.orgreturnsthese results. if you don't see your site, check out thetechnical requirementsto make sure there's nothing technically preventing your site from showing in google search, and then come back here. google primarily finds pages through links from other pages it already crawled. in many cases, these are other websites that are linking to your pages. other sites linking to you is something that happens naturally over time, and you can also encourage people to discover your content bypromoting your site. if you're open to a little technical challenge, you could alsosubmit a sitemap—which is a file that contains all the urls on your site that you care about. some content management systems (cms) may even do this automatically for you. however this isn't required, and you should first focus on making surepeople know about your site. when google crawls a page, it should ideallysee the page the same way an average user does. for this, google needs to be able to access the same resources as the user's browser. if your site is hiding important components that make up your website (likecssandjavascript), google might not be able to understand your pages, which means they might not show up in search results or rank well for the terms you're targeting. if your pages have different information depending on the user's physical location, make sure you're satisfied with the information that google sees from its crawler's location, which is generally the us. to check how google sees your page, use theurl inspection tool in search console. it might be important for you to opt out your site as a whole or sections of it from appearing in search results. for example, you might not want your posts about your new embarrassing haircut to show up in search results. google supports various ways that lets you opt out of crawling and indexing of your urls. if you need to block some files, directories, or even your whole site from google search, check out our guide aboutways to prevent content from appearing in search results. when you're setting up or redoing your site, it can be good to organize it in a logical way because it can help search engines and users understand how your pages relate to the rest of your site. don't drop everything and start reorganizing your site right now though: while these suggestions can be helpful long term (especially if you're working on a larger website), search engines will likely understand your pages as they are right now, regardless of how your site is organized. parts of the url can be displayed in search results as breadcrumbs, so users can also use the urls to understand whether a result will be useful for them. google learns breadcrumbs automatically based on the words in the url, but you can also influence them withstructured dataif you like a technical challenge. try to include words in the url that may be useful for users; for example: a url that only contains random identifiers is less helpful for users; for example: if you have more than a few thousand urls on your site, how you organize your content may have effects on how google crawls and indexes your site. specifically, using directories (or folders) to group similar topics can help google learn how often the urls in individual directories change. for example, consider the following urls: the content in thepoliciesdirectory seldomly changes, however the content in thepromotionsdirectory likely changes very often. google can learn this information and crawl the different directories at different frequencies. to learn more about search-friendly site structures, check out ourguide for ecommerce sites, for which a good url structure is more important as they tend to be larger. some websites show the same content under different urls, which is calledduplicate content. search engines choose a single url (thecanonicalurl) to show users, per piece of content. having duplicate content on your site is not a violation of our spam policies, but it can be a bad user experience and search engines might waste crawling resources on urls that you don't even care about. if you're feeling adventurous, it's worth figuring out if you canspecify a canonical versionfor your pages. but if you don't canonicalize your urls yourself, google will try to automatically do it for you. when working on canonicalization, try to ensure that each piece of content on your site is only accessible through one individual url; having two pages that contain the same information about your promotions can be a confusing user experience (for example, people might wonder which is the right page, and whether there's a difference between the two). if you have multiple pages that have the same information, try setting up aredirectfrom non-preferred urls to a url that best represents that information. if you can't redirect, use therel=""canonical""linkelement instead. but again, don't worry too much about this; search engines can generally figure this out for you on their own most of the time. creating content that people find compelling and useful will likely influence your website's presence in search results more than any of the other suggestions in this guide. while ""compelling and useful content"" can mean different things to different people, content like this generally shares some common attributes, such as: think about the words that a user might search for to find a piece of your content. users who know a lot about the topic might use different keywords in their search queries than someone who is new to the topic. for example, some users might search for ""charcuterie"", while others might search for ""cheese board"". anticipating these differences in search behavior and writing with your readers in mind could produce positive effects on how your site performs in search results. however, don't worry if you don't anticipate every variation of how someone might seek your content. google's language matching systems are sophisticated and can understand how your page relates to many queries, even if you don't explicitly use the exact terms in them. while ads are a part of the internet and are meant to be seen by users, don't let them become overly distracting or prevent your users from reading your content. for example, advertisements, orinterstitial pages(pages displayed before or after the content you're expecting) that make it difficult to use the website. links are a great way to connect your users and search engines to other parts of your site, or relevant pages on other sites. in fact, the vast majority of the new pages google finds every day are through links, making links a crucial resource you need to consider to help your pages be discovered by google and potentially shown in search results. additionally, links can also add value by connecting users (and google) to another resource that corroborates what you're writing about. link text(also known asanchor text) is the text part of a link that you can see. this text tells users and google something about the page you're linking to. withappropriate anchor text, users and search engines can easily understand what your linked pages contain before they visit. links can provide more context on a topic, both for users and search engines, which may help demonstrate your knowledge on a topic. however when you're linking to pages outside of your control, for example content on other sites, make sure you trust the resource you're linking to. if you can't trust the content and you still want to link to them, add anofollowor similar annotationto the link to avoid search engines associating your site with the site you're linking to. this helps avoid potential negative consequences in your rankings in google search. if you're accepting user-generated content on your site, such as forum posts or comments, make sure every link that's posted by users has anofollowor similar annotation automatically added by your cms. since you're not creating the content in this case, you likely don't want your site to be blindly associated with the sites users are linking to. this can also help discourage spammers from abusing your website. a typical google search results page consists of afew different visual elementsthat you can influence to help users decide whether they should visit your site through those search results. in this section, we're focusing on thetitle linkand thesnippetbecause these are the more visually significant elements. thetitle linkis the headline part of the search result and it can help people decide which search result to click. there are a few sources that google uses to generate this title link, including the words inside the<title>element (also called the title text) and other headings on the page. this title text can also be used for the title that's shown in browsers and bookmarks. how to make your own chili oil you can influence the title links in search by writing good titles: a good title is unique to the page, clear and concise, and accurately describes the contents of the page. for example, your title could include the name of your website or business, other bits of important information like the physical location of the business, and maybe some information about what the particular page has to offer for users. ourdocumentation about title linkshas more tips about how to create good titles and how to influence your site's search results' title links. below the title link, a search result typically has a description of the target page to help users decide whether they should click the search result. this is called asnippet. learn how to cook eggs with this complete guide in less than 5 minutes. we cover all the methods, including sunny side up, boiled, and poached. the snippet is sourced from the actual content of the page the search result is linking to, thus you have complete control over the words that can be used to generate the snippet. occasionally the snippet may be sourced from the contents of the meta description tag, which is typically a succinct, one- or two-sentence summary of the page. a good meta description is short, unique to one particular page, and includes the most relevant points of the page. check out our tips forwriting good meta descriptionsfor more inspiration. many people search visually, and images can be how people find your website for the first time. for example, if you have a recipe blog, people might find your content by searching for ""fruit tart recipes"" and browsing photos of various types of fruit tarts. as you add images to your site, make sure that people and search engines can find and understand them. when you use high quality images, you give users enough context and detail to decide which image best matches what they were looking for. for example, if people are looking for ""daisies"" and come across a rogue edelweiss in search results, a higher quality image would help them distinguish the type of flower. use images that are sharp and clear, and place them near text that's relevant to the image. the text that's near images can help google better understand what the image is about and what it means in context to your page. for example, if the page is reviewing yarn shops in london, then it would make sense to embed one of your photos of the yarn shop in the section that details the location, description, and review information for that yarn shop. this helps google and users associate the image with text that provides more context to what the page is about. alt text is a short, but descriptive piece of text that explains the relationship between the image and your content. it helps search engines understand what your image is about and the context of how your image relates to your page, so writinggood alt textis quite important. you can add this to your html with thealtattribute of theimgelement, or your cms may have an easy way to specify a description for an image when you're uploading it to your site. learn more abouthow to write good alt text, and how to add it to your images. if your website includes pages that are primarily about individual videos, people may also be able to discover your site through video results in google search. many of the best practices for images and text also apply to videos: if your site is particularly video-focused, then continue reading about more things you can do tooptimize your videos for search engines. effectively promoting your new content will lead to faster discovery by those who are interested in the same subject, and also by search engines. you can do this in many ways: one of themost effective and lasting waysis word of mouth: that is, people familiar with your site tell their friends about it, who in turn visit your site. this can take time, and usually you need to invest some time and effort in other practices first, such as community engagement. our friends over at google for creators have excellent resources aboutbuilding and engaging your audience. putting effort into the offline promotion of your company or site can also be rewarding. for example, if you have a business site, make sure its url is listed on your business cards, letterhead, posters, and other materials. with their permission, you could also send out recurring newsletters to your audience letting them know about new content on your website. as with everything in life, you can overdo promoting your site and actually harm it: people may get fatigued of your promotions, and search engines may perceive some of the practices asmanipulation of search results. as seo has evolved, so have the ideas and practices (and at times, misconceptions) related to it. what was considered best practice or top priority in the past may no longer be relevant or effective due to the way search engines (and the internet) have developed over time. to help you focus on the things that are actually important when it comes to seo, we collected some of the most common and prominent topics we've seen circulating the internet. in general, our message on these topics is that you should do what's best for your business area; we will elaborate on a few specific points here: when picking the name of your site, do what's best for your business. users will use this name to find you, so we recommend following general marketing best practices. from a ranking perspective, the keywords in the name of the domain (or url path) alone have hardly any effect beyond appearing inbreadcrumbs. and while still on the topic of domain names: the tld (the domain name ending like "".com"" or "".guru"") only matters if you're targeting a specific country's users, and even then it's usually a low impact signal. for example, if you're trying to sell dutch cheese to people searching from switzerland, it makes some sense (both from business andseo point of view) to use a .ch domain name. otherwise google search doesn't care which tld you're using (whether it's a .com or .org or .asia). having your headings in semantic order is fantastic for screen readers, but from google search perspective, it doesn't matter if you're using them out of order. the web in general is not valid html, so google search can rarely depend on semantic meanings hidden in the html specification. there's also no magical, ideal amount of headings a given page should have. however, if you think it's too much, then it probably is. as you embark on your seo journey, here are some resources that

(at this stage, focus specifically on the ""what""âwe'll get to the ""how"" in later steps.) it may help to structure your goals with smart methodology.smart goalsare specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. below are some examples to draw from: generate 50 percent more qualified leads in 90 days.â double the number of social media followers in 60 days.â get 100 new email rs in 30 days. who are the potential customers you'd like to introduce to your business? this group of people makes up your target audience, and they likely have some shared characteristics worth keeping in mind as you develop your content. it may help to create a buyer persona, which is a fictional representation of your target customer that you use to guide your content creation process. developing personas can make it easier to reflect on target customersâ needs and how your content can meet those needs.â some questions to ask as you develop your buyer persona include: what are their demographics and psychographics? what are their interests, values, and needs? how does your business fit into their lives? as you prepare your content strategy, it can also help to research how your target audience receives, consumes, and engages with content, as well as their preferred communication styles. before you plan to create new content, it's worth revisiting the content you already have. consider what types of content you've published, how well your content has performed, and whether your existing content has historically contributed to your company's goals. additionally, consider the opposite: whether any of your content has underperformed or moved you away from your goals. through assessing your current content library, you can gather hints about the types of content that your target audience might like or dislike in the future, and use this knowledge to guide future content plans. in addition to auditing your own content, you may be able to learn more about your target audience through acompetitor analysis. evaluating the competitive landscape can help reveal industry standards and opportunities to create fresh content that fills gaps and better serves customers. during a competitor analysis, you'll examine the content practices of businesses targeting audiences who are similar to your target audience. take note of the types of content they publish, where they publish, how their audience engages with their content, and the topics they cover. then, consider what aspects of their content strategy you may want to adopt and how you can elevate your content beyond their offerings. next, think about the types of content that you can reasonably create, your target audience is likely to react positively to, and that can help you reach your content goals. you may also consider different types of content for different stages of the customer journey. some common types of content to consider include: once you choose the types of content that make the most sense for your needs, consider the steps you'll need to take to optimize your content types for the platform you plan to focus on. for example, if you're publishing blog posts on your company website, you may want to usesearch engine optimization (seo)techniques and tools, which can help surface your content on search engines like google for relevant search terms. or, if you plan to incorporate social media content creation into your content strategy, you may want to consider the hashtags your target audience may follow or the viral moments they're responding to. knowing how you'll optimize your content types for your chosen platforms is one way to think strategically about your content. at this point, you have a strong foundation on which to start strategically planning your actual content. reflect on the work you've done so far to determine the content topics you'd like to address across your various content types. here, consider topics at the intersection of your unique expertise and your target audience's interests, values, or needs. you may also brainstorm ways you can further conversations around content areas that have historically performed well for you or that perform well for your direct business competitors. leveraging your content across different platforms is another way to strategically approach your content. audiences may have different communication expectations across different platforms. think about how you can repurpose content pertaining to the same topic across your chosen platforms. some people find it helpful to organize their content plan with a content calendar or an editorial calendar. with your pevelolan in place, youâll have more clarity around what you'll need to do in order to begin generating your content. consider the people you'll need on your content team in order to meet your goals and execute your plan, whether that's content strategists tasked with audience research and ideation, content creators willing to appear on camera, or writers who can serve as subject matter experts. also, consider the tools you might need as you develop and publish your content. tools may include a content management system (cms),social listeningtools, or editing software. since you'll need to generate content on a regular basis, a streamlined creation process can make it easier over time to come up with new ideas and build continuous content that serves your audience and expands your goals. once your content is published and your audience begins engaging with it, youâll need to have a plan in place for measuring how well the content performs. many websites, social media platforms, and email systems report metrics like the number of views or clicks a piece of content gets and how many people are subscribing or following over a span of time. determine the metrics that are most relevant to your content goals, then decide on the best way to track those metrics over time. once you begin to see how your content is performing, this will provide you with a basis for adjusting individual pieces of content or the strategy as a whole.â continue exploring how a strong content

https://emotive.io/blog/11-essential-digital-marketing-tips,11 Essential Digital Marketing Tips | Emotive,"in today's digital world, companies of all sizes and sectors have an online presence. that makes the competition for shoppers' attention fierce. out of the 2.1 million ecommerce businesses in the us, only a fraction of them will be able to attract enough customers and grow online sales. as an ecommerce merchant, you've probably figured out that digital marketing is critical for the long-term success of your online store. but what exactly is digital marketing, and how do you do it? let's find out. in pre-internet days, businesses could promote themselves through billboards, television spots, direct mail, or store window displays. but with commerce and consumers (and, let's face it, most of our attention) moving to the online world, marketing and advertising have moved online, too. marketers can now reach their target audience via digital channels such as social media, search engines, websites, text messages, and email, and these comprise what we think of as digital marketing or online marketing. though the traditional channels are still in play, the digital marketing world offers several advantages. with online marketing you can reach global audiences.â personalization allows you to target and segment more effectively. efficiency and automation let you do more with less marketing budget, even with a small marketing team. your brand can attain greater visibility across digital channels. software makes adopting digital marketing strategies faster and easier. you can communicate with customers more rapidly and frequently. data collection and analysis enables your business to make better decisions. to capitalize on opportunities and stand out from your competition in this digital landscape, you need a successful digitalmarketing strategy. that means embracing a range of digital marketing activities. for example, software review site g2 has found that marketers using three or more channels in their campaigns see a purchase and engagement that's rate 250% higher than marketers using single channels.(1) your digital marketing strategy might include popular inbound marketing tactics like social media, paid advertising, email marketing, influencer marketing, content marketing, seo strategy, google adwords, affiliate marketing, andconversion rate optimization. and if your digital strategy doesn't yet include text marketing, it should. that's because text marketing consistently yields higher conversion rates than email and paid ads. g2 says text marketing âcontinues to be a best-kept secret ... 61% of marketers still donât use it.â(2) emotive helps ecommerce businesses harness the power of texting as a key component of a successful digital marketing strategy. but we know there's more to it than just texting, so we're sharing our best digital marketing tips with you. understanding your target audience is an essential step in ecommerce marketing. who are they? what are their interests, needs, and desires? where do they spend their time? to identify and understand your customers, you may want to conduct market research: this can be as simple as surveying some of your existing customers. you'll use this data to develop various buyer personas and a customer journey, which maps the steps a prospective customer takes on the path from anonymous shopper to loyal purchaser. you'll want to define customer segments, based on factors like age, gender, occupation, income, location, and interests. with a clear picture of your target customer, you can begin to create targeted marketing campaigns that speak to their interests. and don't forget customer feedback: this is a great source of data you can use to improve your offerings and your brand's customer experience. one of the most important aspects of digital marketing is creating compelling and relevant content that draws people to visit your website. clickbait content might get shoppers' attention, but if it doesn't provide value to your target audience, they'll likely leave before making a purchase. valuable content can be in the form of blog posts, videos, infographics, or social media posts. following are some marketing tips for effective content creation: post content regularly. create content that's entertaining, informative, and empathetic.â ensure your content is original and reflects your brand values. make use of infographics and video.â customize content for different digital platforms. consider asking customers to create user-generated content, featuring your products. don't skimp on photography or design: aesthetics matter. don't just promote your products: your content should speak to customers' needs and desires. maintain consistent branding so shoppers can more easily identify you. your website is the gateway to revenue, so it's important to optimize it for conversions. this means making sure it's easy to navigate, has a clear call-to-action, loads quickly, and offers frictionless checkout. optimizing your website for conversions can yield a significant increase in online sales. your site can also help you collect valuable customer data, such as top purchases, browsing history, click pathways, and more. by analyzing this data and identifying patterns, you'll discover opportunities for future optimizations and can target and segment customers more effectively.â your website and published content should also include top search keywords: the words and phrases that customers type into search engines when looking for products, services, and websites like yours. google, most ecommerce platform providers, website builders, and other companies offer free tools that can help you research keywords and optimize your content accordingly. most of your current and prospective customers spend a large part of their days scrolling their social media accounts, or hanging out in online communities at reddit and discord. here are some social media marketing tips to help you take advantage of these ubiquitous platforms. identify the platforms and communities where your customers spend time. monitor what kinds of things they share about your business and industry, and their feelings about it.â publish content that entertains, educates, or informs your target audience: not just about your brand and products, but about your audience's needs and desires.â engage with your followers regularly by listening and responding to them on the social media platform or online community where they hang out.â employ high-quality images and video, as these are the most popular content forms.â did you know that the top 1000 north american-based online retailers receive 65% of their traffic from mobile devices?(3)if your website isn't optimized for mobile, you're likely losing new customers (and maybe even some loyal ones as well.) make sure that your website looks good, loads quickly, and is easy-to-use on all devices. optimize your site so that it's responsive on all digital devices like mobiles, tablets, and laptops. measure your page speed as this is a critical factor to hook customers to your website. if the web pages load at a slow speed, chances are that your customers would leave the website. when framing mobile-friendly content: keep your content short and straightforward. use infographics and video content.â create a presence on social media as mobile users spend most of their screen time on social media platforms. a key component of digital marketing is integrating your messaging, branding, and campaigns across many different platforms at once. managing content across digital channels can be a challenging task but it's a critical to succeed online. here are some digital marketing tips for integrating across platforms: develop long-term digital marketing strategies that map to your mission and goals use a crm tool to track customer data and better understand audience behavior run a/b tests and pay attention to conversion metrics like open rate, ctr, etc. create a content calendar and socialize it across your organization maintain consistent branding (fonts, colors, writing style) across channels google my business is a free platform that allows businesses to create a listing on google. it's free to use and a great way to reach potential customers, especially if you're a local business with customers who live near you. make sure to claim your business listing and fill out all the information correctly. other advantages of google my business: you can add or update relevant information about your business, such as contact details, website url, images, videos, events, business hours, and more customers can rate your business and add a review, which means you can respond to feedback and learn what your audience likes or dislikesâ adding your shop to google my business is a form of search engine optimization that enhances your search rankings you'll get timely reports with data on your business listing, such as the number of page views, notifications about user reviews, and more there's a reason email is still the foundation of most digital marketing efforts: it's a high-volume, low-cost way to stay in touch with customers, remind them about your business, and promote your products, sales, and news. a plethora of software products make it easy to build email templates, track open rates and clicks, and keep your email list compliant and up-to-date. and adding a form, banner, or pop-up on your site to collect email addresses is an easy way to grow your potential customer base. email is an ideal channel for communicating important information and timely information, but for urgent messages, look to sms. sms marketing â especially when it's two-way andconversationalâ helps you build relationships, create a sense of urgency, and meet shoppers where they spend a majority of their time: on their phones. though a majority of marketers rely on email marketing, research firm gartner has found that text marketing campaigns have response rates are 7x higher and click-through-rates more than 30 times higher than email.(4)texts are an ideal channel for high-conversion marketing messages, such asabandoned cartreminders, black friday sales and other promotional content, and personalized or segmented messages based on user data.â pay-per-click advertising is one of the most effective digital marketing strategies for reaching your target audience and driving traffic to your site. it can feel risky to spend money on digital ads, but in the highly competitive ecommerce marketplace, ppc ads are table stakes. ppc ads can be a useful tool for experimenting with your message and brand, with the end goal being that you learn what gets the most clicks and can constantly improve your roi. google ads and youtube ads are examples of ppc advertising, as are social media platforms like instagram, linkedin, twitter, and facebook. every day we share key pieces of information about ourselves online. as an ecommerce business, you can harness this data in respectful and legal ways to better understand your shoppers and connect them with the products they need and desire. this kind of personalization â whether it's addressing emails to customers by their first name, or notifying customers that an item they browsed at your website is back in stock â is a key competitive advantage in digital marketing. research from demand metric finds that 82% of customers feel more positive about a brand after engaging with personalized content.(5)by personalizing your content to shoppers' needs and interests, you'll be able to improve your conversions and see a higher return on investment for your efforts. just as online stores are an evolution from brick-and-mortar stores. digital marketing tools make marketers more efficient, data-driven, and effective online. they can

follow-up questions. digital marketing is one of the most popular and powerful ways to generate awareness, interest and sales for your products or services. as the name implies, digital marketing is conducted via digital avenues, including social media, websites, search engines, email and text messaging. for optimal results, you must understand which digital marketing tactics will work best for your target audience. this post offers an in-depth look at the most effective digital marketing strategies and best practices for achieving your business goals. also known as online marketing orinternet marketing, digital marketing communicates messages through digital channels accessed through electronic devices, including phones, computers and tablets. digital marketing and traditional marketing, such as print ads and direct mail, share the same ultimate goal: generating product awareness and influencing purchasing decisions to drive sales. the main difference between traditional and digital marketing is that digital marketing uses internet-connected technologies to communicate and engage with targeted audiences. the launch of the world wide web in 1989 set the stage for the emergence of digital marketing. the proliferation of business websites, advancements in email technologies and the introduction of wildly popular social channels have sparked meteoric growth in digital marketing. online marketing is now a key component in most businesses’ marketing plans primarily because of the widespread use of digital technologies but also because it can deliver outstanding results. to succeed, businesses must find effective ways to spread the word about their products and services and that’s never been more challenging than today. consumers face more choices from more providers, all clamoring for their attention. deploying compelling content on digital marketing platforms is one way to stand out from the crowd. another reason digital marketing is so important to businesses is simply this: it’s where your ideal customer is hanging out. according to the research experts at statista, as of 2023, there are 5.19 billion internet users and 4.88 billion social media users worldwide. on average, internet users spend six hours and 40 minutes online every day. this enormous, highly engaged online audience presents tremendous opportunities for businesses that want to gain visibility for their goods and services. digital marketing offers near-endless opportunities for connecting with potential customers and is a vital component of nearly every business’smarketing mix. creating a soliddigital marketing strategyfor your business begins with a better understanding of the types of digital marketing methods that yield the best returns. below, we introduce you to six types of digital marketing: social media marketing, search engine marketing (seo), pay-per-click (ppc) advertising, email marketing,mobile marketingand content marketing. social media marketingis one of the most popular forms of digital marketing. in the united states alone, over 308 million people access a social network at least once per month. people of all ages use social media for entertainment, interacting with others, gaining information about specific interests and shopping. for businesses hoping to gain visibility and sales,social media statisticsreveal that incorporating social media into your marketing mix can be a sound strategy. social media is the go-to source for brand information for 78% of internet users. nearly half of u.s. consumers report they’ve made a purchase through social media. top social platforms include youtube, facebook, tiktok, instagram, whatsapp, pinterest, linkedin, snapchat and x (formerly twitter). new platforms, such as bereal and poparazzi, are entering the market regularly. the social landscape is ever-evolving. for example, twitter, now x, was once a top platform, but the social channel now appears to be struggling. twitterhas lost approximately 32 million userssince elon musk purchased the platform in 2022. tiktok didn’t even come on the international scene until 2017, but now hasmore than 1.7 billion monthly active users. digital marketers need to remain attentive to social media channel changes. search engine optimization (seo) is a vital digital marketing strategy for businesses that benefit from driving traffic to their websites. seo is the process of optimizing your website so search engines, such as google rank your website high on search engine results pages (serps). seo is all about driving organic traffic to your site. unlike paid advertising, with seo, visitors who find your site come from unpaid searches. approximately 8.5 billion searches are done on google daily, which presents a lot of opportunities for businesses that want to promote their product and services. ranking high on google is key to driving more traffic to your website. in a surveyconducted by search engine journal, 49% of respondents reported that seo delivers the highest return on investment (roi) of any digital marketing channel. you can get started with seo on your own for free by learning more about google ranking factors or with the help oftop seo tools and software. you can also work with anseo serviceor agency to create an seo plan and manage your seo for you. ppc advertising is precisely what the name implies: you pay a fee every time someone clicks on your digital ads. the amount you’ll pay is determined by the platform you’re advertising on, the potential traffic for your promoted post and the number of competitors willing to pay for similar ads. google ads is the largest ppc platform in the world. many businesses who engage in seo marketing also engage in ppc advertising on google. paid ads on google appear above organic search results and that positioning advantage can drive even more traffic to your website. google ads is not your only avenue for ppc advertising. you can also purchase ppc ads via the microsoft search network on bing and partner sites as well as on top social channels, including youtube, facebook, instagram, snapchat, linkedin, amazon and tiktok. email marketing is another top digital marketing strategy you’ll likely want to add to your marketing mix. according to statista, businesses earn an average of at least $32 for every dollar spent on email marketing. for some sectors, such as retail, e-commerce and consumer goods, that number is $45. to be effective at email marketing, you must develop a strategy for collecting email addresses from clients and prospects. many businesses collect emails with every customer encounter, sometimes offering a special incentive for joining an email list. your business website is also a terrific place to offer incentives to visitors so you can grow your email database. growing and nurturing your email list is vital tosuccessful email marketing. you also must respect the communication preferences of your list and only send relevant information that your base wants to receive. also, failing to manage the legal aspects of email marketing, including staying compliant withcan/spam actmandates, is paramount for email marketing success. rather than managing business email manually, most marketers acquire email marketing software. thebest email marketing softwaremakes it effortless to keep your email database updated, handling new rs and uns for you. your email software should also make it easy to segment your email database based on customer interests, create attractive email designs, manage email scheduling and measure email metrics, including open rates, click-through rates (ctr), conversion rates and bounce rates. check out our list ofemail marketing examplesto get a better idea of the topic. there are more than 310 million smartphone users in the u.s. alone, so it should be no surprise that mobile marketing has become a popular digital marketing strategy for businesses. mobile marketing typically is conducted via text, also called short message service (sms). text open rates are estimated to be as high as 98%, which is one reason mobile marketing can be so effective. while text messaging is the most common way to market via mobile devices, notifications from mobile apps and social channels can also be received on smartphones. the business applications for mobile marketing are expanding every day. every form of digital marketing relies on compelling content to attract interest and engage prospects and customers.content marketingis the term used to describe the different types of content you can develop to deploy in your digital marketing campaigns. content marketing can take many forms, including blogs, infographics, whitepapers, ebooks, videos, podcasts, quizzes, slide decks and webinars. unlike advertising, content marketing is not blatantly promotional but instead employs more subtle tactics to inform, educate or influence a desired target market. you can use content marketing to establish authority on particular subjects or create buzz for your brand. one of the key advantages of content marketing is that you can do it on virtually any budget. a do-it-yourself (diy) approach to content marketing will cost you mere pennies or, if your budget allows, you can work with copywriters, videographers, designers and other content development experts to create content for your business. read ourcontent marketing statisticsguide to learn more about the value of content

launching a company website is the first step in digital marketing for many businesses. the additional digital marketing methods you choose depend on what you’re selling, where your ideal audience is spending their time and how much money you want to spend on digital marketing. social media, seo and email are the most popular digital marketing techniques, but you may find a different mix works best for your target market. the beauty of digital marketing is that it’s relatively easy to track results. in setting your goals, you establish what you’re hoping to achieve. in the analysis stage of digital marketing, you measure how well you’re performing against established goals. set a cadence for how often you’ll monitor digital marketing performance data: daily (which is only advised in initial stages or when digital marketing spending is high), weekly or monthly. very few digital efforts achieve stellar results out of the gate, so don’t be disheartened if you aren’t hitting stretch

the goals of their marketing strategy, marketers can support a larger campaign through the free and paid channels they have available. a content marketer, for example, could create a series of blog posts thatgenerate leadsfrom an ebook. a social media marketer might help promote those blogs through paid and organic posts on thebusiness's social media accounts, and the email marketer could create anemail campaignto send those who download the ebook more information on the company. our2025 state of marketing reportfound that the top five marketing channels that resulted in the biggest roi in 2024 involved digital marketing. they are: digital marketing helps you reach a larger audience than you could through traditional methods and target the prospects who are most likely to buy your product or service. additionally, it's often more cost-effective than traditional advertising and enables you to measure success on a daily basis and pivot as you see fit. there are a few major benefits of digital marketing: digital marketing allows you to identify and target a highly specific audience with personalized and high-converting marketing messages. for instance, you might use social media targeting to show ads to a certain audience based on variables like age, gender, location, interests, networks, or behaviors. alternatively, you might useppc or seo strategiesto serve ads to users who've shown interest in or searched for specific keywords related to your product, service, or industry. ultimately, digital marketing helps you conduct the research necessary to identify your buyer personas and refine your strategy to ensure you’re reaching prospects most likely to buy. digital marketing helps you track campaign performance day to day, so you know which channels are performing well and which aren’t. this information helps you optimize your campaign budgets for high roi. a digitalmarketing strategyallows you to pivot continuously, ensuring you never waste money on channels that don't perform well. for instance, if you work for asmall business with a limited budget, you might try investing in social media, blogging, or seo — three strategies that can give you high roi even with minimal spending. if you work for a small business, it's likely difficult for you to compete with the major brands in your industry, many of which have millions of dollars to invest in campaigns. fortunately, there are plenty of opportunities to outrank the big players through strategic digital marketing initiatives. for instance, you might use long-tail keywords to create high-quality content that ranks on search engines. search engines don’t care which brand is the biggest, but they do care about prioritizing content that resonates best with target audiences. adilo, an online video hosting platform competing against established brands in the space, understood the potential of focusing on search. “we knew that trying to compete head-on with paid strategies like tv commercials, ppc, and print media would be a disaster, so we went all-in on content marketing … we also invested heavily in creating original and linkable articles to gain exposure and earned media,” saysfelix johnson, senior seo and content strategist atadilo. today, johnson notes that over 95% of new signups come from google search. one of the biggest benefits of digital marketing is that it gives a start-to-finish view of all the metrics that matter to your company — including impressions, shares, views, clicks, and time on the page. unlike most offline marketing efforts, digital marketing allows marketers to see accurate results in real time. if you‘ve ever put an advertisement in a newspaper, you’ll know how difficult it is to estimate how many people flipped to that page and paid attention to it. there's no surefire way to know if that ad was responsible for any sales at all. on the other hand, with digital marketing, you can measure the roi of pretty much any aspect of your marketing efforts. here are some examples: with digital marketing, you can see the exact number of people who have viewed your website's homepage in real time by usingdigital analytics softwareavailable in marketing platforms like hubspot. you can also see how many pages they visited, what device they were using, and where they came from, amongst other digital analytics data. this intelligence helps you prioritize which marketing channels to spend more or less time on based on the number of people those channels drive to your website. with digital marketing, you can identify trends and patterns in people‘s behavior before they’ve reached the final stage in their buyer's journey, meaning you can make more informed decisions about how to attract them to your website right at the top of the marketing funnel. measure the performance of all your marketing campaigns in one place with built-in analytics, reports, and dashboards. imagine you‘ve created a product brochure and posted it through people’s letterboxes — that brochure is a form of offline content. unfortunately, you have no idea how many people opened your brochure or threw it straight into the trash. if you have that brochure on your website, you can measure how many people viewed the page it’s on, and you can use a form to collect the contact information of those who downloaded it. it’s twofold: you measure how many people engage with your content and generate qualified leads when people download it. aneffective digital marketing strategycombined with the right tools and technologies allows you to trace all of your sales back to a customer's first digital touchpoint with your business. we call this attribution modeling. it allows you to identify trends in the way people research and buy your product, helping you to make more informed decisions about which parts ofyour marketing strategydeserve more attention and which parts of your sales cycle need refining. a great benefit of digital marketing is the ease with which you can change your strategy. adapting a digital marketing strategy is much easier than other, more traditional forms of marketing, like mailers or billboard advertising. for instance, if an online ad isn’t delivering as expected, you can quickly adjust it or pause it to yield better results. as digital marketing makes it simpler to measure your marketing efforts,improving your conversion ratebecomes simpler as well. being able to measure the effectiveness of each tactic helps you develop better strategies. continuously refining your methods improves your conversion rate. investing in online marketing ensures that everything is optimized for the highest amount of conversions. additionally, not all leads offer the same value for your business. digital marketing allows you to target a specific audience, which will yield higher-quality leads that are more likely to become customers. connecting your business with the most valuable leads will directly improve your conversion rate. engaging your audience as early as possible is essential. making a connection at the first stage of thebuyer’s journeyhelps push the lead through the customer funnel. using digital marketing allows you to accomplish that from start to finish and at every point in between. online channels allow you to follow your customers' entire buying journey. understanding and analyzing how customers operate is important for converting leads. digital marketing allows you to track them through that process. and, even if they don’t convert in the early stages, it at least helps ensure they have made a connection with your business. another way to connect with your customers is to ensure brand content resonates with customer values. oursurveyrevealed that 37.52% of marketers feel that one of the biggest ways the marketing industry changed in the past twelve months is focusing on the customer, and their experience with the brand became more important. additionally, one in five (21.19%) said that one of the top marketing trends they or their teammates are currently exploring is creating content that reflects brand values. richard white, content team lead atomnisend, an ecommerce email marketing and sms platform, says, “we’re absolutely aligning our content with our brand values because we believe that it’s the only way to make digital marketing work long-term.” white says his team sticks stick to topics that actively help customers grow their businesses. then, then listen for to see the response. “direct feedback, support

topic, service, or brand. influencer marketingfalls under sponsored content, but with the exponential rise of content creators and influencers, i believe it deserves its own section. here, a brand sponsors an influencer in its industry to publish posts or videos related to the company on social media. according tomarketers, instagram and facebook are the top two platforms delivering the highest roi from influencers. anothertrendthat appeared is the rise of the niche or small-scale influencer as a key channel.44.88% of marketerssay they saw the most success with micro influencers/content creators in 2024 i.e., those with 10,000-99,999 followers/rs. the biggest benefits of working with influencers with a following count under 100k compared to those with higher? more trust with followers, access to niche and tight-knit communities, and lower costs. katerina andreeva, head of talent relations athypefactory, a global influencer marketing agency, says, “while working with micro-influencers, we notice how perfectly imperfect and sincere the content they create is. they have the honesty that the modern audience is looking for among ai-generated content and deep fakes.” she adds that micro-influencers cover niche topics that speak directly to often-overlooked audiences. this makes creators attractive to a narrow audience, creating a community of like-minded people around the influencer. “since the audience of micro-creators is engaged and loyal, the conversion rate of the brand's advertising message increases,” andreeva says. finding the right content creators

generation through all the digital channels — both free and paid — that are at a company's disposal. these channels include social media, the company's own website, search engine rankings, email, display advertising, and the company's blog. the digital marketer focuses on each channel‘s key performance indicators (kpis) to properly measure performance. for example, a digital marketer in charge of seo might measure their website’s organic traffic. at small companies, one person might own many digital channels and tactics described above, while larger companies typically have a specialist focused on one or two brand channels. here are some examples of these specialists: seo managers work to rank a business on google serps. using various seo strategies, this person might work directly with content creators to ensure the content is high-quality and up to google’s standards, even if the company also posts this content on social media. content marketing specialists are digital content creators. they might keep track of a blogging calendar or develop a content strategy that includes video. they often work with people in other departments to ensure products and campaigns are supported by promotional content on all digital channels. a social media manager's role depends on each company and industry. above all, social media managers manage social media by establishing a posting schedule for the company’s written and visual content. they might also work with a content marketing specialist to develop a strategy for which content to share on social media. (note: per the kpis above, “impressions” refer to the number of times a business‘s posts appear on a user’s newsfeed.) interestingstat:social media roles are sought after in marketing recruitment.

manage thesoftwarea marketing team uses to understand customer behavior and measure business growth. many of the marketing operations described above might be executed separately, so it’s important for there to be someone who can group these activities into individual campaigns and track performance. inbound marketing is a methodology that uses digital marketing assets to attract, engage, and delight customers online. digital marketing, on the other hand, is simply an umbrella term to describe online marketing tactics of any kind, regardless of whether they're considered inbound or outbound. digital marketing is often compared toinbound marketing, but it doesn’t differentiate between ‘inbound’ and ‘outbound’ methods. it’s more of an umbrella term for all marketing that involves digital communication, while inbound marketing is more of a strategy. digital outbound tactics put a marketing message in front of as many people as possible online — regardless of whether it's relevant or welcomed. for example, the garish banner ads you see on websites that push a product or promotion to people who aren’t necessarily ready to receive it. marketers who employ digital inbound tactics use online content to attract their target customers by providing assets that are helpful to them. one of the simplest yet most powerful inbound digital marketing assets is a blog, which allows your website to capitalize on the marketing agency, says, “performance drives the balance between free and paid digital marketing strategies. long gone are the days where half of our marketing dollars are wasted.” according to eagling, free strategies tend to build brand and community — two vital pillars of a successful strategy. while free tactics are “hard to see value from, the paid strategies are the fuel. they propel the free strategies,” she says. natalie adds that the agency uses brand lift studies or correlates data from paid campaigns that have also had free strategies running alongside them to show clients that combining both can yield more powerful results. so, when in doubt, try both, and iterate on your process as you learn which channels — paid or free — perform best for your brand. once you know your audience and have a budget, it's time to start creating content for the various channels you will use. this content can be social media posts,blog posts, ppc ads, sponsored content, email marketing newsletters, and more. to create conversion-focused content consider usingcontent marketing software. with this software, you can utilize an ai-powered content writing tool, repurpose blog posts into content for other channels, and improve your content quality by optimizing it with built-in seo recommendations. another key component of digital marketing is mobile marketing. in fact,smartphone usage as a wholeaccounts for 69% of time spent consuming digital media in the u.s., while desktop-based digital media consumption makes up less than half — and the u.s. still isn‘t mobile’s biggest fan compared to other countries. this means optimizing your digital ads, web pages, social media images, and other digital assets for mobile devices is essential. if your company has a mobile app that enables users to engage with your brand or shop for your products, your app falls under the digital marketing umbrella, too. those engaging with your company via mobile devices need to have the same positive experience as they would on a desktop. this means implementing a mobile-friendly orresponsive website design with content hubto make browsing user-friendly on mobile devices. it might also mean reducing the length of your lead generation forms to create a hassle-free experience for people downloading your content on the go. as for your social media images, it's important to always have a mobile user in mind when creating them, as image dimensions are smaller on mobile devices, and text can be cut off. there are lots of ways you can optimize your digital marketing assets for mobile users, and when implementing any digital marketing strategy, it's hugely important to consider how the experience will translate on mobile devices. by ensuring this is always front-of-mind, you‘ll be creating digital experiences that work for your audience, and consequently achieve the results you’re hoping for. digital marketing is all about reaching targeted audiences through personalized content — all of which can't happen without effectivekeyword research. conducting keyword research is critical for optimizing your website and content for seo and ensuring people can find your business through search engines. additionally, social media keyword research can also help market your products or services on various social channels. you‘ll still want to conduct keyword research even if you don’t have a full-time seo strategist. try creating a list of high-performing keywords related to your products or services, and consider long-tail variations for added opportunities. finally, to create an effective digital marketing strategy for the long term, it's vital your team learn how to pivot based on analytics. for instance, perhaps after a couple of months, you find your audience isn't as interested in your content on instagram anymore — but theylovewhat you're creating on x. sure, this might be an opportunity to re-examine your instagram strategy as a whole, but it might also be a sign that your audience prefers a different channel to consume branded content. alternatively, perhaps you find an older web page isn't getting the traffic it used to. you might consider updating the page or getting rid of it entirely to ensure visitors are finding the freshest, most relevant content for their needs. in any case, having access to all of this data in the same place through platforms likehubspot analyticscan be a godsend. you can track performance across multiple channels within easy-to-digest dashboards, compare their results side-by-side, and get all the data necessary to quickly spot new opportunities and adjust your strategy. interesting stat:according tomarketers, a data-informed marketing strategy helps their team understand which marketing strategies are the most effective. this information also allows marketers to understand the roi of their marketing efforts and reach their target audience most effectively. and 8 out of 10 (82%) say that having a single source of truth for their marketing data is beneficial to their organization. however, data privacy changes such as gdpr and google’s decision to phase out third-party cookies have left a mark. 88% of marketers say that data privacy changes impacted their marketing strategy over 2024. digital marketing provides businesses with incredibly flexible opportunities for continuous growth — but it's up to you to take advantage of them. if you‘re already doing digital marketing, you’re likely reaching some segments of your

foster a deep, emotional connection with its audience. to ensure your content remains focused and aligned with your brand’s objectives, you can build your content plan around a set ofsocial media content pillars. regardless of what you might post,coming up with a hashtagto couple with your content is a brilliant branding move. hashtags can be used to get your attention and encourage people to share their photos interacting with your brand. one of the best ways to stand out on social media is to have a distinct brand voice. chances are you’ve seen a post from a particular brand that just feels like, well, theirs. the quippy, casual tone that makes discord’s x presence beloved by casual users and moderators alike is a great example. the key is to present yourself as a human rather than a robot. adopt a consistent brand voice and style that’s appropriate for your business. timeliness is arguably more important than ever for marketers. not only are you expected to put out fresh content regularly, but also to always be “on” for your followers. but you can’t always expect customers to operate on your clock. plus, timeliness is a tall order when you’re strapped for resources or

they can help you craft stand-out content for your audience. according to the2024 influencer marketing report, consumers overall look to engage with influencers who align with their personal values (53%) and seem authentic (47%), even when posting sponsored content and taking part inbrand campaigns. across ages and genders, honest and unbiased content stops audiences mid-scroll, while

strong—and is even growing among younger consumers—only 35% of gen z value authenticity, compared to nearly half of millennials, gen x‌ and baby boomers. this indicates that younger generations are more aware of theinfluencer-brand relationshipand how it influences their buying decisions, but they’re comfortable with it. instead, they prioritize other indicators of trustworthiness, such as follower count, posting frequency‌ and community loyalty. social media teams have a unique advantage when it comes to understanding customer sentiment. you’re the eyes and ears for your brand online. those insights can do more than just inform your marketing strategy. they can transform your business. stand-out social media teams will approach cross-department collaboration with enthusiasm and intention. the short answer? all of them. index data shows around three-quarters of marketing leaders already say organic and paid social marketing are top priorities for the organization. however,

that, if they have a monthly check-in, for example, and they just want to know how some of our strategic priority areas are performing at that time, we can pull kpis specific to those areas.” peiffer notes. through reporting on social data you’re also able to achieve greater transparency and accessibility through meaningful metrics. “data-driven decision-making is being built into the culture beyond our social media and web team, because we can build greater transparency and accessibility using reporting and social listening dashboards,” she says. “because these reports are highly visual, and can be as robust or simple as we need them to be to communicate with key stakeholders, it allows us to empower really anyone to communicate the results of our efforts on social media in a way that is meaningful to their goals—whether that be an executive to a governance council, a director to our dean or an account manager to a service line physician,’ peiffer adds. social media marketing enables businesses greater segmentation and tracking through platform-specific data and insights from ai-powered tools like sprout. you can target audiences based on demographics, interests, behaviors and even sentiment analysis through social listening. plus, advanced targeting features like custom and lookalike audiences can ensure your ads reach the most relevant users. as sprout customers, penn state health has used sprout’staggingfeature to help benefit from improved segmentation and tracking for their marketing and communications objectives on social media. “the tagging architecture within sprout has really allowed us to have greater segmentation and tracking for those separate and distinct audiences and also the variety of content that we’re putting out,” peiffer notes. ai-powered analytics further helps track engagement, conversions and customer journeys. this will enable you to tailor content to audience personas and optimize campaigns in real-time for better social roi and audience alignment. content that resonates with your customers, including user-generated content and success stories, often goes hand-in-hand with higher engagement and conversion rates. social gives you the advantage of curating this impactful content quickly. for example, you can monitor mentions and tags to uncover positive customer interactions and then share them on your social media channels to nurture brand trust. many brands also curate customer photos to use throughout their marketing campaigns. this is why having a branded hashtag is so important. by encouraging your customers to tag their content, you can find shareable posts that your followers will love while also making a connection with your customers. you can manage this process effectively through a dedicatedugc platform. apublishing calendarcan also be useful to ensure your curated content is posted at a consistent rate to ensure you have a steady brand social media presence. however, when it comes to cyclical content, constantly creating awesome content can be taxing—a challenge all brands face.ai in social mediacan help overcome this block and even enhance creativity. “there’s only so many ways over time i can think to say it’s national doctors day, thank a doctor who has made a difference in your life,” peiffer explains. “as social media managers, we can use tools like generative ai to get ‘unstuck’ in these creative blocks and tailor it to our own brand voice and audience preferences,” she adds. sprout’s ai tools have made a difference in how penn state health’s social team creates brand content. “i appreciate that sprout gives several options when generating text. i’m sometimes pulling from this piece and adding it to another, or it just inspires a wholly separate thought and i’m writing something entirely different. that inspiration saves time and helps find a new way to say the same thing,” peiffer notes. generative ai tools likesprout social’s ai assistin compose can help you create content easily. all you have to do is add a few thoughts or drop a link and you get multiple caption options in different tones. similarly, thesuggestions by ai assistcapability helps improve social media posts by instantly generating multiple variations of the post or adjusting its tone. yet another important way to optimize your content strategy is to have a balanced mix of videos, infographics, carousels and user-generated content to create multi-format content and keep engagement high. it’s also important to align content with your brand persona and not jump on every trend you see on social. the 2025 sprout social index™ revealed this as one of the top things consumers want brands to stop doing. brands need to be constantly accessible to customers because with social, customers are just a touch of a button away from brands they want to reach. this can also mean overwhelmed social teams balancing customer support, content management and slicing and dicing data for reporting. however, with an intuitive social media management solution, this daunting task can become easy as pie. according to amy, penn state health’s social team was able to build custom reports faster and more efficiently, such that the time to build customer reports dropped by nearly 70%. they also reduced errors by 80% and troubleshooting turnaround time from 3-5 days to within an hour. this collective efficiency helped save team resources as well. “we eliminated the need for an additional contractor-supported role due to efficiency gained for full-time team members,” peiffer explains. this video explains how the sprout team uses our own tool to save time and increase workflow efficiency. per the latest sprout social index™, among the top things customers want brands to start doing in 2025 is prioritizing quick, personalized customer care. social customer care by sprout socialhelps brands achieve this. whether it’s through case management that enables global customer care teams to be on the same page or tools like saved replies that help deliver quick service while maintaining brand voice, you deliver the best customer experience ever, and more importantly, humanize your brand. peiffer says, “what we found in years of inquiries was that there were certain themes and frequent requests to our social media pages. using sprout, we built saved replies that centralized how to locate those resources for our audiences, but could still be individualized and customized to impart that humanity to our social media communications, which i think is so important in health care. in sprout, we’re able to unlock this potential and allow our team to focus on more strategic objectives.” this brings us to customer engagement and building your own brand community. one of the ways to nurture a thriving brand community is to respond to comments and messages promptly. tools like sprout’s smart inbox or message alerts help you in doing that because they automatically categorize messages according to priority. collaborate with brand advocates to extend your reach and infuse your social media with authentic, relatable content. plus, encourage user participation through polls, q&a and challenges. this will help you grow and sustain your brand’s community with loyal followers. analyze and track your efforts consistently. this includes testing your ad creatives, captions and posting times to ensure they are optimized for your audience. tools like sprout’ssuggestions by ai assist and viralpost ™capabilities enable you to do just this. analyze your content performance as well and use that data to refine your approach. with sprout’staggingfeature, you can pull tag-based reports that make it easy to assess what makes something resonate with your audience and see how it aligns with your strategic priority area. you can see what’s performing well and apply those data-backed learnings to other projects to build your annual campaigns. this approach has also helped penn state health win executive buy-in. “the ability to customize how specifically we want to be able to sort, filter and measure data has allowed us to build really enhanced reporting that provides sometimes real-time feedback to stakeholders in ways we haven’t always been able to,” peiffer says. “it’s something that not only allows us to plan better as we’re laying out our campaigns and our social strategy for the year, but then also to go back and to report to others when they say, i don’t understand why you did this, or i don’t understand why we don’t do something else. we have the data and the insights available to communicate effectively why our decisions are what they are and to support them as we go forward,” she adds. another important factor is to keep track of platform algorithm changes so you aren’t caught off-guard and adapt your strategy accordingly. this cohesive approach will also enable you to create benchmarks that you can lean on for future campaigns. if you set actionable goals and address each of the steps above, you’ll already be way ahead of the curve when it comes to your social media marketing strategy. try out

the answer: by knowing how to harness ecommerce seo. ecommerce search engine optimization (seo) is the process of fine-tuning your website to meet search engine best practices, which includes updating your content to reflect what your customers are searching for. benefits of seo for store owners include increased visitors, brand awareness, and sales. but with constant search engine algorithm updates, knowing how to approach search optimization can be difficult. this guide covers the basics of ecommerce seo, including how to research keywords, structure your site, and create content for product pages. equipped with this guide, andthis seo checklist, you’ll be set up to rank your store and reap some seo rewards. ecommerce seo is the process of increasing the visibility of an online store in search engine results pages (serps). ecommerce websites use seo as a strategy to generate more traffic, attracting visitors who input queries related to their products and brand. the tasks involved in ecommerce seo marketing are varied. for example, creating optimized website content is one seo task you might undertake. your content could show up in relevant search results that catch the attention of new customers and guide them to purchase. for example, an ecommerce store liketrue classic, which sells t-shirts, could improve its website seo by optimizing collection and product pages. as you begin the process of optimizing your online store, the most essential ecommerce seo tasks to prioritize include: other important tasks include: speeding uppage load time, crafting detailedproduct descriptions, and doingbacklink outreach. after prioritizing these seo activities, you can consider creating informational content to provide additional value and traffic sources. this informational content, likeblog postsor help center articles, should target queries that a customer would likely ask before purchasing an item. true classic, for example, devotes an entire page to theirdifferent fabric options in detailso that shoppers can explore and get to know the products more deeply. when you search for something on google, you’re taken to a search engine results page (serp). there, you’ll find approximately 10organic results: these organic results appear below paid ads (orange) and google shopping ads (purple): ecommerce seo is all about ensuring your product pages appear among the top organic search results on the first page of google. websites that don’t rank within the top 10 are rarely visited, and even those in positions three to five receive far less traffic than the top results. 😲 worth noting:seo company backlinko found that only0.63% of searchersclick on websites listed on page two of google search results. backlinko also reported that the first result on a google serp gets 27.6% of all the clicks: in other words: seo matters. the name of the game is to rank as high as possible on the first page of search engines like google and bing—both for search s required. most businesses budget $1,500–$5,000 per month for intensive outsourced seo projects. shopify stores have seo features to help you optimize your content. for example, you can create optimized product titles, descriptions, alt text, and urls. you can also harness the power ofshopify magicto ai-generate optimized descriptions of your products. other seo features include the ability to submit your sitemap to google search console and create a blog for your online store. adding a blog to a shopify store can help it rank for relevant keywords that don’t compete with product pages. for example, a shopify store selling birthday party supplies may rank for product-focused keywords such as “balloons,” “streamers,” and “gifts.” adding some thoughtful blog posts to this website may enable it to appear in other queries from motivated users, such as “how to plan a birthday party.” it’s important to consider seo for your shopify store because it helps increase visibility in search engine result pages (serps). when you optimize a shopify store for users (by creating pages that address queries and acquiring backlinks from relevant websites) it will rank higher in results. the more pages you do this for, the more pages start ranking. getting website traffic from organic search results helps you attract customers and spend less on paid marketing. the newsletter for entrepreneurs join millions of self-starters in getting business resources, tips, and inspiring stories in your inbox. un anytime. by entering your email, you agree to receive marketing emails from shopify. by proceeding, you agree to theterms and conditionsand. un anytime. by entering your email, you agree to receive marketing emails from shopify. by proceeding, you agree to theterms and conditionsand. learn on the go. try shopify for free, and explore all the tools you need to start, run, and grow your business. start free then enjoy 3 months for $1/month",850
